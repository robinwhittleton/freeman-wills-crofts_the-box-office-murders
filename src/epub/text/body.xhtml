<h2>Chapter I. <br/> The Purple Sickle</h2>

<p>Inspector Joseph French, of the Criminal
Investigation Department of New Scotland Yard,
sat writing in his room in the great building on
Victoria Embankment. Before him on his desk lay
sheet after sheet of memorandum paper covered
with his small, neat writing, and his pen travelled
so steadily over the paper that an observer might
have imagined that he had given up the detection
of crime and taken instead to journalism.</p>

<p>He was on a commonplace job, making a <i>précis</i>
of the life history of an extremely commonplace
burglar. But though he didn’t know it, Fate,
weighty with the issues of life and death, was even
then knocking at his door.</p>

<p>Its summons was prosaic enough, a ring on his
telephone. As he picked up the receiver he little
thought that that simple action was to be his
introduction to a drama of terrible and dastardly crime,
indeed one of the most terrible and dastardly crimes
with which he had ever had to do.</p>

<p>“That Inspector French?” he heard. “Arrowsmith
speaking—Arrowsmith of Lincoln’s Inn.”</p>

<p>A criminal lawyer with a large practice, Mr.
Arrowsmith was well known in the courts. He and
French were on friendly terms, having had tussles
over the fate of many an evildoer.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Arrowsmith. I’m French.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a young lady here,” Mr. Arrowsmith
went on, “who has just pitched me a yarn which
should interest you. She has got into the clutches
of a scoundrel who’s clearly up to no good. I don’t
know what he’s after, but it looks mighty like a
scheme of systematic theft. I thought you might
like to lay a trap and take him redhanded.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would please me better,” French
returned promptly. “Shall I go across to your
office?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s not necessary. I’ll send the girl to the
Yard. Thurza Darke is her name. She’ll be with
you in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! I’ll see her directly she comes. And
many thanks for your hint.”</p>

<p>Though he spoke cordially, French was not
impressed by the message. Communications purporting
to disclose clues to crimes were received at the
Yard every day. As a matter of principle all were
investigated, but not one in a hundred led to
anything. When therefore some half hour later Miss
Darke was announced, French greeted her
courteously, but without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>She was a pretty blonde of about five and twenty,
with a good manner and something of a presence.
Well but plainly dressed in some light summery
material, she looked what she evidently was, an
ordinary, pleasant, healthy young woman of the
lower middle classes. French put her down as a
typist or shopgirl or perhaps a bookkeeper in some
small establishment. In one point only did she seem
abnormal. She was evidently acutely nervous.
There was panic in her eyes, tiny drops of perspiration
stood on her face, and the hand in which she
grasped her vanity bag trembled visibly.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Darke,” said French, rising
as she entered and pulling forward a chair.
“Won’t you sit down?” He gave her a keen glance
and went on: “Now, if you’ll excuse me for two or
three minutes I’ll be quite at your service.”</p>

<p>He busied himself again with his papers. If her
nervousness were due to her surroundings she must
be allowed time to pull herself together.</p>

<p>“Ready at last,” he went on with his pleasant
smile. “Just take your time and tell me your
trouble in your own way and it’ll be a strange thing
if between us all we’ll not be able to help you out.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him gratefully and with some
surprise. Evidently she had expected a different
kind of reception. French noted the glance with
satisfaction. To gain the confidence of those with
whom he had to deal was his invariable aim, not
only because he valued pleasant and friendly relations
for their own sake, but because he felt that in
such an atmosphere he was likely to get more valuable
details than if his informant was frightened or
distrustful.</p>

<p>“So you know Mr. Arrowsmith?” he prompted,
as she seemed to have a difficulty in starting. “A
good sort, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He seems so indeed, Mr. French,” she answered
with a suggestion of Lancashire in her accent. “But
I really can’t say that I know him. I met him this
morning for the first time.”</p>

<p>“How was that? Did you go to consult him?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly: that is, it was through Miss Cox,
Miss Jennie Cox, his typist. She is my special
friend at the boarding house we live at. She told
him about me without asking my leave. He said he
would hear my story and then she came back to the
boarding house and persuaded me to go and tell it
to him.”</p>

<p>“She thought you were in some difficulty and
wanted to do you a good turn?”</p>

<p>“It was more than that, Mr. French. She knew
all about my difficulty, for I had told her. But she
believed I was in danger and thought somebody
should be told about it.”</p>

<p>“In danger? In danger of what?”</p>

<p>The girl shivered.</p>

<p>“Of my life, Mr. French,” she said in a low tone.</p>

<p>French looked at her more keenly. In spite of this
surprising reply, there was nothing melodramatic
in her manner. But he now saw that her emotion
was more than mere nervousness. She was in point
of fact in a state of acute terror. Whatever this
danger might be, it was clear that she was fully
convinced of its reality and imminence.</p>

<p>“But what are you afraid may happen to you?”
he persisted.</p>

<p>Again she shivered. “I may be murdered,” she
declared, and her voice dropped to a whisper.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, my dear young lady, people are
not murdered in an offhand way like that! Surely
you are mistaken? Tell me all about it.” His voice
was kind, though slightly testy.</p>

<p>She made an obvious effort for composure.</p>

<p>“It was Eileen Tucker. She was my best friend.
They said she committed suicide. But she didn’t,
Mr. French! I’m certain she never did. She was
murdered. As sure as we’re here, she was murdered!
And I may be too!” In spite of her evident
efforts for self-control, the girl’s voice got shrill and
she began jerking about in her chair.</p>

<p>“There now,” French said soothingly. “Pull
yourself together. You’re quite safe here at all
events. Now don’t be in a hurry or we’ll get mixed
up. Take your own time and tell me everything
from the beginning. Start with yourself. Your
name is Thurza Darke. Very good now; where do
you live?” He took out his notebook and prepared
to write.</p>

<p>His quiet, methodical manner steadied the girl
and she answered more calmly.</p>

<p>“At 17 Orlando Street, Clapham. It’s a boarding
house kept by a Mrs. Peters.”</p>

<p>“You’re not a Londoner?”</p>

<p>“No. I come from Birkenhead. But my parents
are dead and I have been on my own for years.”</p>

<p>“Quite. You are in some job?”</p>

<p>“I’m in charge of one of the box offices at the
Milan Cinema in Oxford Street.”</p>

<p>“I see. And your friend, Miss Jennie Cox, who
also lives at Mrs. Peters’ boarding house, is typist
to Mr. Arrowsmith. I think I’ve got that straight.
Now you mentioned another young lady—at least I
presume she was a young lady—a Miss Eileen
Tucker. Who was she?”</p>

<p>“She was in one of the box offices at the
Hammersmith Cinema.”</p>

<p>“Same kind of job as your own?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I met her at an evening class in arithmetic
that we were both attending and we made friends.
We were both bad at figures and we found it came
against us at our work.”</p>

<p>French nodded. The name, Eileen Tucker,
touched a chord of memory, though he could not
remember where he had heard it. He picked up his
desk telephone.</p>

<p>“Bring me any papers we have relative to the
suicide of a girl called Eileen Tucker.”</p>

<p>In a few moments a file was put before him. A
glance through it brought the case back to him. It
was summarized in a cutting from the <i>Mid-Country
Gazette</i> of 10th January of that year. It read:</p>

<blockquote><div>

  <p class="headline">“TRAGIC DEATH OF A YOUNG GIRL</p>

  <p>“Dr. J. S. Jordan, deputy coroner for South
  Eastern Surrey, held an inquest at the Crown Inn,
  Caterham, yesterday morning on the body of a young girl
  which was found in a quarry hole about a mile from
  the town and not far from the road to Redhill. The
  discovery was made by a labourer named Thomas
  Binks, who was taking a short cut across the country
  to his work. Binks reported the affair to the
  police and Sergeant Knowles immediately visited the
  scene and had the body conveyed to the town. The
  remains were those of a girl of about twenty-five,
  and were clothed in a brown cloth coat with fur
  at the collar and cuffs, a brown skirt and jumper
  and beige shoes and stockings. A brown felt hat
  lay in the water a few feet away and in the right
  hand was clasped a vanity bag, containing a cigarette
  case and holder, some loose coins and a letter. This
  last was practically illegible from the water, but
  enough could be made out to show that it was from
  a man of undecipherable name, breaking off an illicit
  relation as he was going to be married. Dr. Adam
  Moody, Caterham, in giving evidence stated that
  death had occurred from drowning, that there were
  no marks of violence, and that the body had
  probably been in the water for two or three days. At
  first the identity of the deceased was a mystery, but
  Sergeant Knowles handled the affair with his usual
  skill and eventually discovered that she was a Miss
  Eileen Tucker, an employee in the box office of the
  Hammersmith Cinema in London. She seemed to
  have been alone in the world, having lived in a
  boarding house and no relatives being discoverable.
  After considering the evidence, the jury, with Mr.
  John Wells acting as foreman, brought in a verdict
  of suicide while of unsound mind.”</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>“A sad case,” said French sympathetically, when
he had finished the paragraph. “I see that the jury
brought in a verdict of suicide, but you think the
poor young lady was murdered? Now just tell me
why you think so.”</p>

<p>“I know it! I’m sure of it! She wasn’t the kind
of girl to commit suicide.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but you’ve surely something more
definite to go on than that?”</p>

<p>“No proof, but I’m as certain of it as if I had
been there. But what she told me about the man
shows it wasn’t what they said.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite follow you. What did she tell
you?”</p>

<p>“She was in trouble through some man, but not
the kind of trouble the letter said. There was no
love affair or anything of that kind. It was money.”</p>

<p>“Money?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I thought at first she had got into debt to
this man and couldn’t pay and I offered to lend her
what I could; it wasn’t very much. But she said it
wouldn’t help her; that the man had her in his power
and that she was frightened. I begged her to tell me
particulars, but she wouldn’t. But she was
frightened all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to suggest anything bad about the
poor young lady, but doesn’t it look as if he had
found her out in something that she shouldn’t have
done? Tampering with the cinema cash, for
example?”</p>

<p>Miss Darke looked distressed.</p>

<p>“That was what I feared,” she admitted, “but of
course I didn’t let her know I suspected it. And of
course I don’t know that it was that.”</p>

<p>French was frankly puzzled.</p>

<p>“Well, but if all that’s true, it surely supplies a
motive for suicide?”</p>

<p>“It might have with another girl, but not with
her. Besides, there was the letter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you mentioned the letter before. Now how
does the letter prove that it wasn’t suicide?”</p>

<p>Miss Darke paused before replying and when at
last she spoke it was with less conviction.</p>

<p>“I looked at it like this,” she said. “From the
letter it would be understood that some man had got
her into trouble and then deserted her. From what
she told me that wasn’t so and from what I know
of her it wasn’t so. But if that’s right there couldn’t
have been any letter—not any real letter, I mean.
I took it the letter had been written by the murderer
and left in her bag to make it look like suicide.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself French was interested. This
was a subtle point for a girl of the apparent
mentality of this Miss Darke to evolve from her own
unaided consciousness. Not, he felt, that there was
anything in it. The probabilities were that the
unfortunate Eileen Tucker had been deceived and
deserted by the usual callous ruffian. Naturally she
would not tell her friend. On the other hand, he
considered that Miss Darke was surprisingly correct
in her appreciation of the psychological side of
the affair. The older French grew the more weight
he gave to the argument that X hadn’t performed a
certain action because he “wasn’t the sort of person
to do it”: with due reservation, of course, and
granted an adequate knowledge of X’s character.</p>

<p>“That’s a very ingenious idea, Miss Darke,” he
said. “But it’s only speculation. You don’t really
know that it is true.”</p>

<p>“Only from what she said,” returned the girl.
“But I believed her.”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Darke,” French said gravely, “I am
afraid I have a serious question to ask you. If you
knew all these material facts, why did you not come
forward and give evidence at the inquest?”</p>

<p>The girl hung her head.</p>

<p>“I know I should have,” she admitted sadly, “but
I just didn’t. I did not hear of Eileen’s death till
I saw it in the paper the day after and it didn’t say
where the inquest would be. I ought to have gone to
Caterham and asked, but I just didn’t. No one
asked me any questions and—well, it seemed easier
just to say nothing. It couldn’t have helped Eileen
anyway.”</p>

<p>“It might have helped the police to capture her
murderer, if she was murdered,” French returned.
“And it might have saved you from your present
difficulties. You were very wrong there, Miss
Darke; very wrong indeed.”</p>

<p>“I see that now, Mr. French,” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Well,” said French, “that’s not what you called
to talk about. Go on with your story. What can
you tell me about the man? Did Miss Tucker
mention his name or describe him?”</p>

<p>Miss Darke looked up eagerly, while the expression
of fear on her features became more
pronounced.</p>

<p>“No, but she said there was something horrible
about him that just terrified her. She hated the sight
of him.”</p>

<p>“But she didn’t describe him?”</p>

<p>“No, except that he had a scar on his wrist like a
purple sickle. ‘A purple sickle,’ were her exact
words.”</p>

<p>“H’m. That’s not much to go on. But never
mind. Tell me your own story. Try to put the
events in the order in which they happened. And
don’t be in a hurry. We’ve all the day before us.”</p>

<p>Thurza Darke paused, presumably to collect her
thoughts, then went on:</p>

<p>“The first thing, I think, was my meeting Gwen
Lestrange in the train.”</p>

<p>“What? Still another girl? I shall be getting
mixed among so many. First there is yourself, then
Miss Jennie Cox, Mr. Arrowsmith’s typist, then
poor Miss Eileen Tucker, who died so sadly at
Caterham. And now here’s another. Who is Gwen
Lestrange?”</p>

<p>“I met her first in the train,” Miss Darke
repeated. “I go to my work most days by the Bakerloo
tube from the Elephant to Oxford Circus. One
day a strange girl sitting beside me dropped a book
on to my knee and we began to talk. She said she
came by that train every day. A couple of days
later I met her again and we had another talk. This
happened two or three times and then we began to
look out for each other and got rather friends. She
was a very pleasant girl; always smiling.”</p>

<p>“Did you find out her job?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she said she was a barmaid in the Bijou
Theatre in Coventry Street.”</p>

<p>“Describe her as well as you can.”</p>

<p>“She was a big girl, tall and broad and strong
looking. Sort of athletic in her movements. She
had a square face, if you know what I mean; a big
jaw, determined looking.”</p>

<p>“What about her colouring?”</p>

<p>“She was like myself, fair with blue eyes and a
fair complexion.”</p>

<p>“Her age?”</p>

<p>“About thirty, I should think.”</p>

<p>French noted the particulars.</p>

<p>“Well, you made friends with this Miss
Lestrange. Yes?”</p>

<p>“The thing that struck me most about her was
that she seemed so well off. She was always well
dressed, had a big fur coat and expensive gloves and
shoes. And once when I lunched with her we went
to Fuller’s and had a real slap-up lunch that must
have cost her as much as I could spend in lunches in
a week. And she didn’t seem the type that would be
getting it from men.</p>

<p>“I said that I couldn’t return such hospitality as
that and she laughed and asked me what I was getting
at the Milan. Then she said it was more than
she got, but that there were ways of adding to one’s
salary. When I asked her how, she smiled at first,
but afterwards she told me.”</p>

<p>French’s quiet, sympathetic manner had evidently
had its effect. Miss Darke had lost a good deal of
her terror, and her story was coming much more
spontaneously. French encouraged her with the
obvious question.</p>

<p>“She said she had got let in on a good thing
through a friend. It was a scheme for gambling on
the tables at Monte Carlo.”</p>

<p>“At Monte Carlo?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was run by a syndicate. They had a
man there who did the actual playing. They sent
him out the money and he sent back the winnings.
You could either choose your number or colour or
you could leave it to him to do the best he could for
you. If you won you got your winnings less five per
cent for expenses: if you lost, of course you lost
everything. But the man did very well as a rule.
He worked on a system and in the long run you made
money.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself French became more interested.
The story, he felt, was old—as old as humanity.
But the setting was new. This Monte Carlo idea
was ingenious, though it could take in only the
ignorant. Evidently it was for this class that the
syndicate catered.</p>

<p>“And that was how Miss Lestrange had made
her money?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Apparently Miss Darke had not questioned
the fact. “She said that as a rule she made
a couple of pounds a week out of it. I said it was
well for her and that I wished that I had an obliging
friend who would let me into something of the kind.
She didn’t answer for a while and then she said that
she didn’t see why I shouldn’t get in if I wanted
to. If I liked she would speak to her friend about it.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t very keen at first for at one time or
another I had seen a deal of trouble coming through
gambling. But I thought a little fling wouldn’t do
me any harm so I thanked her and asked her to go
ahead. If she won, why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed? And did she arrange it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I didn’t see her for three or four days,
then I met her in the train. She said she had fixed
up the thing for me and if I would come in early
next morning she would introduce me to the man
who took the stakes. Our jobs started about one
o’clock, you will understand, Mr. French, so we had
plenty of time earlier.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I suppose you both worked on till
the places closed in the evening.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. We were done about eleven or a
little later. Well, next morning I met her at eleven
and we saw the bookmaker, Mr. Westinghouse.
Gwen had told me that his office was rather far away
and that he would meet us in the Embankment
Gardens at Charing Cross. And so he did.”</p>

<p>“Now before you go on you might describe Mr.
Westinghouse.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you just what he was like,” the girl
returned. “You know those big American business
men that you see on the films? Clean shaven and
square chins and very determined and all that?
Well, he was like that.”</p>

<p>“I know exactly. Right, Miss Darke. You met
Mr. Westinghouse?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Gwen introduced me, and he asked me my
name and a lot of questions about myself and he
wrote down the answers in a notebook. Then he
said he would agree to act for me, but that I was
to promise not to mention the affair, as they wanted
to keep it in the hands of a few. I promised and he
took my stake. It was only five shillings, but he
took as much trouble over it as if it had been pounds.
He wanted to know if I would like to choose my
number, but I said I would leave it to the man on the
ground.”</p>

<p>“And what was the result?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Westinghouse said that he couldn’t undertake
to let me know before the end of a week, on
account of the time it took to write out and back
again, and also because the man did not always
play, but only when he felt he was going to win.
He had a sort of sense for it, Mr. Westinghouse
said. So I met him a week later. He said I had
done well enough for a start. I had won three times
my stake. He gave me nineteen shillings, the fifteen
shillings win and my five shillings back, less five
per cent. I was delighted and I put ten shillings on
and kept the nine. That time I doubled my ten and
got another nineteen shillings. The next time I lost,
but the next I had a real bit of luck.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” French queried with as great a show of
interest as he could simulate. The tale was going
according to plan. He could almost have told it to
Miss Darke.</p>

<p>“That fourth time,” the girl went on, “Mr.
Westinghouse seemed much excited. He said I had
done something out of the common and that it was
only the second case which had occurred since they
started. I had won maximum, that meant thirty-five
times my bet. I had put on ten shillings and
he handed me sixteen pounds twelve and sixpence.”</p>

<p>“A lot of money,” said French gravely.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it? Well, you may imagine, Mr.
French, that after that I went ahead with the thing.
But I never had another bit of luck like that, though
on the whole I did fairly well, at least until lately.”</p>

<p>That, of course, was the next step. She had still
to tell of her loss and the penalty. But that, French
felt sure, was coming.</p>

<p>“About a month ago,” the girl went on, “Gwen
told me she was leaving town. She had got a better
job in the Waldorf Theatre in Birmingham. But I
carried on the gambling all the same. But somehow
after she left my luck seemed to desert me. I
began to lose until at last I had lost everything I
had won and all my small savings as well.”</p>

<p>“And what did Mr. Westinghouse say to that?”</p>

<p>“I told him what had happened and that I couldn’t
go on betting. He seemed cut up about it and said
that if he had foreseen that result he wouldn’t have
taken me on. Then he said it was a real pity I
couldn’t go on a little longer. The luck at the tables
came in cycles and they had been passing through a
specially bad cycle. Several other people had lost
as well as me. He said the luck was due to turn and
that if I could hold on I would be sure to win back
all that I had lost and more. I said I couldn’t as I
hadn’t the money and that was all there was to it.
He said to let things stand for a week and then to
come back to him and he would see what could be
done.”</p>

<p>“And you did?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mr. Westinghouse told me he was glad to
see me as the luck had turned. If I could manage a
really good bet he was certain that I should win
handsomely. I said I hadn’t the money. Then he
hummed and hawed and at last said that he couldn’t
see me stuck; that he felt responsible for me and that
he would help me out. If I would undertake to let
him have half the profits, he would lend me enough
to clear a good round haul. He took two notes out
of his pocket and said here was ten pounds. I could
put it on in one bet if I liked, but he advised me to
put on four bets of two-pound-ten each instead.
Some one or two were sure to get home.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like the idea, but I was sure he wouldn’t
have offered such a thing unless there really was
a good chance. So after some time I thanked him
and agreed. I know I shouldn’t have done it, but
there it is. I’m telling you just what happened.”</p>

<p>French smiled.</p>

<p>“If we were all as wise as we should be, Miss
Darke, there would be no stories to tell. Never
mind. Just go on with yours.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can guess what happened. I lost
every single one of my bets! There was I without
a penny left and owing Mr. Westinghouse ten
pounds.”</p>

<p>Miss Darke evidently had something of the dramatic
sense. She paused unconsciously to give point
to her climax, then went on:</p>

<p>“He was very nice about it at first, but soon I
saw a different side to his character. He began to
press for the money and the more I told him I
couldn’t pay and asked for time, the more persistent
he got. At last about ten days ago he said
that he would give me a fortnight more and that
if I had not paid by then he would go to my
employers and ruin me. When I said that it was his
own fault for tempting me to borrow he got furious
and said I’d see whose fault it was and for me to
look out for myself.</p>

<p>“I was in a terrible state of mind, Mr. French.
I didn’t know what would happen to me or who
to turn to. And then the night before last who
should I meet when I was going home in the tube
but Gwen Lestrange.”</p>

<p>Again Miss Darke paused at her climax, and
French, who had been listening carefully though
without a great deal of interest to the commonplace
little story, offered a sympathetic comment. How
many times had just such a little drama been
enacted, and how many times it would again! Probably
since before the dawn of history gambling had
been used to get the fools of the human race into
the power of the knaves. There was only one point
in the episode still unrevealed—the source of wealth
to which this silly girl had access and from which
Westinghouse expected to be paid. That, however,
would no doubt soon be disclosed. For French could
not bring himself to believe that it was anything
so crude as robbing the till in the cinema, the only
thing which appeared to follow from the story.</p>

<p>“Gwen seemed pleased to see me. She said her
mother had been ill and she had got a couple of
days’ leave from Birmingham. She asked me to
have coffee with her next morning at Lyons’ Corner
House, so that we could have a chat.</p>

<p>“I think I told you I started work about one
o’clock, and shortly before twelve next day I joined
her at Lyons’. She exclaimed at once about my
looks. ‘Why, what on earth’s wrong with you?’
she cried. ‘You’re in trouble of some kind.’</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to talk about myself, but she
insisted on hearing, and when she learned what had
happened she was very angry. ‘That old scoundrel!’
she cried, ‘and I used to think he was straight!’ She
got quite excited about it. She advised me to tell
Westinghouse to go to hell and dare him to do his
worst. He couldn’t do me any harm, she said. I
had only to deny the story and say he had been
persecuting me and he could produce no proof. But
I knew that was no good and that the mere raising
of the question with the cinema manager would lose
me my job. And it would have, Mr. French.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it would,” French admitted.</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t on for it anyway, and when she
saw I wasn’t she let that drop. Then she said that
she felt sort of responsible for me, seeing that it
was through her I got into the thing, and that she
would therefore try and help me out. There was a
cousin of hers, a really good sort, who might be
able to help me. He had helped her at one time
when she was in the same trouble herself. She
would stake her reputation that he at all events
was straight, and if I wished she would introduce
me to him.</p>

<p>“Well, I needn’t take up your time by telling you
all our conversation. It ended in my agreeing to
go to Mr. Style, as the cousin was called. Gwen
fixed up a meeting. I was to be at St. Pancras when
his train came in from Luton, where he lived, and
he would talk to me on the platform. I went there
and he found me at once.”</p>

<p>“You might describe Mr. Style also.”</p>

<p>The girl shivered as if at an unpleasant memory.</p>

<p>“I can easily do that,” she said, and her expression
became almost that of horror. “As long as I
live I’ll remember his appearance. He was thin
and tall and sallow, with a small, fair moustache.
But his eyes were what struck you. He had such
queer, staring eyes that you would think they could
see right into your mind. They made me feel quite
queer. Sort of uncanny, if you understand what
I mean.”</p>

<p>French nodded and she went on:</p>

<p>“He said that his cousin, Miss Lestrange, had
told him of me and the fix I was in, and he thought
he could do something to help me. He said he had
a job which he thought I could do and which would
pay me well. It was easy as far as actual work
was concerned, but it required a young lady of good
appearance and manner and some shrewdness to
carry it through. Also it was highly confidential
and the lady must be above suspicion as to character
and discretion. Those were his words as far
as I remember.”</p>

<p>Again French nodded.</p>

<p>“I said I already had a job which I didn’t want
to give up, but he said I could do his job at the
same time as they didn’t clash. It was perfectly
easy and perfectly safe, but old-fashioned people
mightn’t altogether approve of it and he was glad to
know that I had no prejudices in that respect.</p>

<p>“As you may imagine, Mr. French, I wasn’t very
pleased at this, and I asked him rather sharply
what he meant. And then he said something which
upset me horribly and made me wish I had never
seen him. I scarcely like to repeat it.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you must.”</p>

<p>“He asked me what I thought of a young lady
who gambled on borrowed money which she couldn’t
repay if she lost. Then always with his horrible
smile he went on to say that a potential thief could
scarcely be tied down by out-of-date ideas of
morality.”</p>

<p>“Plain speaking.”</p>

<p>The girl made a hopeless little gesture.</p>

<p>“You may say I should have got up and walked
away,” she continued, “but I just couldn’t. Somehow
I felt as if I had no strength left to do anything.
But I was terribly upset. I had not realized
that I had done anything so serious and I grew sort
of cold when I thought of it. He watched me for
a moment, then he laughed and said not to be a fool,
that I had done what anyone would have done in
my place, and that he only mentioned the matter
so that I might not imagine that I was above the
little weaknesses of ordinary people. I said I had
never imagined anything of the sort, and he answered
that that being so we might get to business.”</p>

<p>Though Miss Darke was now telling her story as
clearly and collectedly as French could have wished,
it was evident that the personality of Style had
profoundly impressed her. The more she spoke of him,
the more nervous and excited she grew. But
French’s sympathetic bearing seemed to steady her
and after a short pause she continued.</p>

<p>“He said then that he would make me a confidential
offer. He would take over all my liabilities
and make me an immediate advance to get me
out of my present difficulties. He would also
guarantee me a substantial increase to my income,
without in any way prejudicing my present job, if I
would do as he asked. He assured me that what
he would ask was absolutely safe if I was careful,
and that though it might not exactly accord with
certain strait-laced ideas, it would not injure anyone
or cause any suffering. He also declared on his
honour it was nothing immoral or connected with
sex. But he said he had no wish to coerce me. I
could think the offer over and I was perfectly free
to take it or leave it as I thought best.”</p>

<p>“A plausible ruffian.”</p>

<p>“I asked him then what the job actually was.
But he said there was time enough for that, and
he began to ask me about the cash at the Milan and
how it was checked, and if I was overlooked in the
box office and how often the manager came round,
and so on. I can tell you I didn’t like it, Mr.
French, and I began to feel I just couldn’t have
anything to say to his job.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” French queried as the girl stopped. “And
then?”</p>

<p>“And then,” repeated Miss Darke excitedly and
with an unconscious dramatic effort, “then he raised
his arm and I saw his wrist. Mr. French, it had a
purple scar like a sickle on the inside!”</p>

<h2>Chapter II. <br/> French Makes an Assignation</h2>

<p>If Thurza Darke had surprised French by her
dramatic declaration, he surprised her even more by
his reply.</p>

<p>“Miss Darke,” he said gravely, though the irrepressible
twinkle showed in his eye, “you’re a born
story-teller!”</p>

<p>The girl started and flushed angrily, but he held
up his hand.</p>

<p>“No,” he said with a smile, “I don’t mean it that
way. I believe everything that you have said. But
I really must compliment you on the way you’re
telling the story. You did that climax uncommonly
well. And I’m not laughing at you either,” he
went on as her expression changed once more. “I
can assure you I consider your statement very
important and am following it closely. Go on now and
tell me what happened after that. By the way, do
you smoke?” He took a box of cigarettes from a
drawer of his desk and held it out.</p>

<p>His little ruse succeeded. Miss Darke had become
very much excited, and though he liked artistic
narrative, he felt it would be too dearly
purchased at the price of accuracy. His intervention
brought her back to earth. She lit a cigarette and
went on more soberly.</p>

<p>“I just sat and stared at the mark while I thought
what poor Eileen Tucker had said. This must be
the man she had described. I thought of what had
happened to her and I shivered with fear. It was
clear what her trouble had been.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, it’s not so clear to me. Just what
did you think it was?”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“I supposed that Style had made her rob the till
of the Hammersmith Cinema, and I supposed he
would try and make me rob the Milan.”</p>

<p>“Not so easy as it sounds,” French declared.
“But perhaps you are right. Yes?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Style evidently saw me looking at the mark
for he seemed annoyed and he covered it up with
his sleeve. I felt I had been rude and I looked
away. But his manner was not so pleasant
afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he had any idea you had known
Eileen Tucker?”</p>

<p>“He asked me the question. That was afterwards,
after we had talked for some time. Just
as I was going away he said: ‘By the way, about a
year ago I met a young lady in your line of business—a
Miss Eileen Tucker. A very nice girl she was,
too. I suppose you never came across her?’ ”</p>

<p>“And what did you say?”</p>

<p>“At first I was going to say yes, then something
came over me and I thought it might be safer if I
said nothing about it. So I said no, that the name
was strange to me.”</p>

<p>“H’m. Do you think he believed you? Did you
hesitate before you answered him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I hesitated, or not very much at
all events. He seemed to believe me all right.”</p>

<p>Ugly, thought French. If this somewhat rambling
statement were true, it looked distinctly ugly.
Indeed, Thurza Darke’s fears as to her personal
safety might not be so misplaced after all. If this
Style had murdered Eileen Tucker, Thurza’s obvious
recognition of the scar would give him a nasty jar.
He would realize that she must have heard of it
from Eileen herself, and the very fact that she had
denied acquaintanceship with the deceased girl
would tell him that she suspected him. For the first
time French began to think the matter might be
serious.</p>

<p>“Before Style asked you if you knew Miss Tucker
you say you had talked for some time,” he went
on. “Tell me what you said.”</p>

<p>“Not very much, Mr. French. I didn’t like his
questions about the cash arrangements at the Milan
and he saw I didn’t. He said he would like an
answer from me, as if I didn’t want the job he
could find plenty of others glad of it. I mightn’t like
the feeling it was something I couldn’t tell my
friends about, but that was what the pay was for.
The actual work was nothing.”</p>

<p>“He made no secret that it was criminal?”</p>

<p>Miss Darke seemed shocked.</p>

<p>“Such a thing never entered my mind,” she
declared. “The worst I thought was that it wouldn’t
be quite straight.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did you say?”</p>

<p>“I said I didn’t like it, and he replied that was
perfectly all right and that he respected people who
said what they meant. Then he got up and said
good-bye and began to walk off.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t let him go?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” Miss Darke admitted. “While I had
been talking to him I had almost forgotten about
my debt to Mr. Westinghouse. But when I saw
him going the remembrance of it seemed to come
down over me like a great cloud. I said to myself:
‘If I do what Mr. Style wants I may be ruined, but
if I don’t I shall be ruined without any doubt.’ It
seemed the lesser evil and I called him back
intending to agree.”</p>

<p>“And did you not agree?”</p>

<p>“No. When it came to the point I just couldn’t,
and I begged for a day or two to think it over.
He said certainly, and for me to meet him at twelve
o’clock on Friday—that’s tomorrow—in the small
room to the left of the Turner Room in the National
Gallery. I could give him my answer then.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said French, “there’s one thing certain
and that is that you’ve done a wise thing by coming
here and telling your story. And you’ve told it
exceedingly well, if I may say so again. Go on, please.”</p>

<p>“That’s about all there is. I was in absolute
misery all that day. In the evening my friend at
the boarding house, Jennie Cox, noticed that there
was something wrong with me and pestered me so
much about it that at last I told her everything.
She said I should ask Mr. Arrowsmith’s advice, but
I said I would do nothing of the kind. That was
all last night.</p>

<p>“This morning about half past ten she came back
to the boarding house and said that in spite of my
objection she had told Mr. Arrowsmith the whole
story. At first I was real mad with her, then I saw
that Mr. Arrowsmith might help me out. So I went
to his office with Jennie and told him everything, just
as I have to you.”</p>

<p>French nodded. For a moment he remained
silent, then leaning forward, he spoke with decision.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Darke, I may tell you at once that
you’re not to be alarmed about yourself. We’ll see
you through. But you must do exactly what I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“You may trust me, Mr. French,” the girl
answered earnestly.</p>

<p>“Very well. Tomorrow you must go to the National
Gallery, as Style asked you. You will tell
him that you have thought over what he said and
that you have decided to do as he asked, provided
he will give you an undertaking to pay you the
money he promised. Don’t show any hesitation so
far as the moral side of the matter is concerned, but
be stiff about the payment. You understand what
I’m after? I want him to think he has got you.
Finally agree to his terms and say you are willing
to start at once.”</p>

<p>Miss Darke looked rather scared as she
promised.</p>

<p>“Please remember that you have nothing to fear.
As a matter of fact you will be watched at the
National Gallery by one of our men and you will
be perfectly safe. But don’t go away anywhere
either with Style or Westinghouse or Miss
Lestrange. Just do as I’ve said and I’ll look after
the rest. Now I’ll say good day, and again I
congratulate you on your wisdom in coming to tell me
your story.”</p>

<p>That he really was on to something serious
French was now inclined to believe. It was worth
looking into at all events, and he determined he
would not only follow up Miss Darke’s adventures,
but also investigate the death of Eileen Tucker.</p>

<p>His first inquiry could be made immediately.
Picking up his telephone, he put through a call.</p>

<p>“That the Bijou Theatre in Coventry Street?
Scotland Yard speaking. I am trying to trace the
movements of a young lady called Gwen Lestrange.
She states she was barmaid with you up till about
a month ago. Can you give me any information
about her?”</p>

<p>“Must be some mistake,” came the reply. “There
never was anyone of the name here.”</p>

<p>“She might have been with you under another
name,” French went on. “She was tall and well
built and fair with blue eyes and a heavy chin.
Always well dressed—a fur coat and so on.”</p>

<p>“No, we had no one answering to that description.
Besides, no barmaid left here about a month
ago.”</p>

<p>French next repeated his inquiry to the Waldorf
Theatre in Birmingham. But no one of the name
was known there either, nor had a new barmaid
been employed within the last four months.</p>

<p>It was what he had expected to hear. Methodically
he turned to the next obvious inquiry.
Sending the descriptions of the three suspects to
the Record Department, he asked if anything was
known of them.</p>

<p>But here again he drew blank. The gang was
not known to the police nor was any of the three
an habitual criminal.</p>

<p>So far as he could see nothing more could be
done till next day. He therefore put the affair out
of his mind and took up routine matters.</p>

<p>About 11.30 next morning French, after an interview
with his immediate superior, Chief Inspector
Mitchell, left the Yard and turned his steps in the
direction of Trafalgar Square. As he walked his
thoughts were occupied with a revolting and
mysterious murder which had taken place the previous
evening near Skipton. He thought it was not
unlikely that the help of the Yard would be
requisitioned, and he wondered, if so, whether the case
would fall to him. None of the other men, so far
as he knew, was disengaged, while he, except for
this trifling business he was now concerned with, was
at a loose end. He hoped he would get it. He
liked the country, especially in summer, and he was
getting accustomed to working away from his base. His
last two big cases, at Starvel<a href="#note1" id="noteref1" class="pginternal">*</a> in Yorkshire
and down in Devonshire at that Dartmoor affair,
had been completed without the help of his staff
at headquarters, and he had found little difficulty in
working alone.</p>

<p>He reached the National Gallery, and going to
the Turner Room, immersed himself in the splendid
exhibits hung therein. Though technically ignorant
of art, he liked pictures, and of all the pictures he
had ever seen, Turner’s gave him most pleasure.
The fact that Miss Darke’s interview was to take
place in the adjoining room did not prevent him
making the most of his opportunities before she and
her dubious acquaintance arrived.</p>

<p>He moved round, looking at canvas after canvas,
and returning again and again to the “Fighting
Temeraire,” which was to him a source of never
ending delight. But all the time he kept half an
eye on the door, resolved that when once Mr. Style
should appear, he should be kept in sight until he
reached his office or his dwelling or some place
from which he could be picked up again if and when
he was required.</p>

<p>Time passed quickly under such pleasant conditions
and soon twelve o’clock, the hour of the
interview, arrived. But there was no sign of either
of the principals. As the minutes slipped away
French suddenly grew anxious. Had he bungled
the affair already?</p>

<p>He had chosen the room beyond that of the
interview in the hope that Style would not see him,
so that he could trail him with more ease and
security. Now he began to wonder if Style had met
the girl at the door and altered the venue to some
other room. If so, he might pick them up as they
were leaving the building. He therefore strolled
to the entrance, and there taking up an
inconspicuous position, watched those departing.</p>

<p>For over half an hour he waited, then remembering
that Miss Darke began work at the Milan at
one o’clock, he concluded his luck was out and went
along to the cinema.</p>

<p>It was a fine new building in Oxford Street, not
more than a hundred yards west of the Circus.
Palatial was scarcely the word with which to
describe it, as it was built in a vastly more lavish
and ornate manner than ninety per cent of the
palaces of the world. French entered a huge hall of
marble and gold in which were a row of box offices
and from which massive bronze doors led to the
auditorium. Only two of the six box offices were
open. French glanced into each, but in neither was
his friend.</p>

<p>Having learnt from an attendant that though the
girl was due for duty, she had not yet arrived, he
sat down to wait. Time crawled slowly on. One-thirty
came, then one-forty-five, then two, and still
she did not appear.</p>

<p>At two o’clock French could stand it no longer.
He saw the manager. But from him he learnt
nothing. Miss Darke had no leave of absence nor
had she sent any apology. She was a reliable girl
and had never before missed an attendance. The
manager had no explanation to offer.</p>

<p>“I should be obliged if you would let me know
at the Yard if she turns up,” said French as he took
his leave.</p>

<p>He was now acutely anxious. Fears of the worst
filled his mind as he drove rapidly to the boarding
house in Orlando Street, Clapham.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was sitting with Mrs. Peters,
the landlady. At once he obtained news. On the
previous evening about half past eleven an attendant
had rung up from the Milan. He had explained that
Miss Darke had asked him to say that her sister had
unexpectedly turned up from Manchester and that
she was going to spend the night with her at her
hotel.</p>

<p>As a matter of form French rang up the Milan.
But the reply was only what he expected. Miss
Darke had left at her usual time without giving
any message to anyone. Sadly French found himself
forced to the conclusion that there could no
longer be any doubt that the gang had got her.</p>

<p>The thought of her disappearance profoundly
upset him. It hurt like a personal affront. An
appeal had been made to him for help. He had
promised help. And he had not given it. . . .</p>

<p>“They’ve been too much for her,” he thought.
“That ruffian Style saw that she suspected him of
Eileen Tucker’s murder and no doubt he shadowed
her to the Yard. He’s told his friends that she’ll
blow the gaff and they’ve done her in, or I’m a
Dutchman.”</p>

<p>In accordance with his usual custom he had added
a description of his caller to the papers which
already formed the beginning of the dossier of the
case. It was the work of a few seconds to call
up the Yard and direct that an urgent call for four
wanted persons should be circulated—those
described under the names of Thurza Darke, Gwen
Lestrange, —— Westinghouse and —— Style in
the file in the top left-hand drawer in his desk. Then
he turned back and with the landlady’s permission
made a detailed search of the missing girl’s
bedroom. But with the exception of a photograph of
the girl herself, he found nothing useful.</p>

<p>On his way back to the Yard he called at Mr.
Arrowsmith’s and interrogated Miss Cox, Miss
Darke’s boarding-house friend, once again without
result. Nor did a visit to telephone headquarters
in the hope of tracing the mysterious call lead to
anything.</p>

<p>By the time he had completed these inquiries it
was getting on towards eight o’clock. As the hours
passed he had been growing more and more
despondent. But there was nothing more he could do
that night. By now the description would be in the
hands of the police within at least fifty miles of
London, and that he had not heard from any of
them seemed to confirm his worst fears.</p>

<p>He was just about to leave the Yard when the
telephone in his room rang.</p>

<p>“Call through from Portsmouth about that
Thurza Darke case,” said the officer in the Yard
private exchange. “Will you take it, Mr. French?”</p>

<p>“Right,” said French, an eager thrill passing
through him. “Scotland Yard. Inspector French
speaking.”</p>

<p>“Portsmouth Police Station. Sergeant Golightly
speaking. Relative to the inquiry as to the
whereabouts of a young lady named Thurza Darke
received this evening, I think we have some
information.”</p>

<p>“Right, sergeant. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“At about nine-thirty a.m. today a report was
received here that the body of a girl had been found
in the sea at Stokes Bay, some three miles east of
Portsmouth. A party of yachtsmen leaving for a
day’s sail had seen it floating about a mile from the
shore. They brought it in and we had it medically
examined. The cause of death was drowning. So
far we have been unable to identify the remains or
to find out how the girl got into the sea. It looks
like suicide. We had already issued a circular when
we saw yours. The remains answer the description
you give.”</p>

<p>“Girl been in the water long?”</p>

<p>“Six or seven hours, the doctor thought.”</p>

<p>“Has the inquest taken place?”</p>

<p>“It’s arranged for ten tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Right, sergeant. I’ll go down—tonight, if
possible. Wait a moment till I look up the trains.”</p>

<p>“There’s an eight and a nine-fifty, sir, from
Waterloo.”</p>

<p>French glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the eight. Can you meet me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>The hands of the station clock were pointing to
ten minutes before ten when French, armed with his
emergency suitcase, left the train at Portsmouth. A
smart-looking sergeant of police was waiting on the
platform and to him French introduced himself.</p>

<p>“The girl was in with me on the previous day,
sergeant, so I can identify her myself. Otherwise
I should have brought someone who knew her.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, sir.” The sergeant was deferential.
“We believe she was a stranger. At least, we
haven’t been able to hear of anyone missing from
anywhere about this district. And your description
just covers her. The body’s lying at the station, so
you’ll know in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Right, sergeant. Let’s walk if it’s not too far.
I’m tired sitting in that blessed train.”</p>

<p>French chatted pleasantly as they stepped along,
true to his traditional policy of trying to make
friends and allies of those with whom he came in
contact. The sergeant was evidently curious as to
what there might be in this girl’s death which so
keenly interested the great “Yard.” But French
forbore to satisfy his curiosity until he should
himself know whether or not he was on a wild goose
chase.</p>

<p>The remains lay on a table in a room off the
yard of the police station. The moment French
raised the sheet with which the head was covered
he recognized the features of the girl he sought.
Poor pretty little Thurza lay there still and
peaceful, her small peccadillos and troubles, her hopes
and her joys over and done with. As French gazed
upon her pathetic features, he grew hot with rage
against the people whose selfish interests had led to
the snuffing out of this young life, before its owner
had had her chance to make what she could of
existence. That she had been deliberately murdered
there could be little doubt, and he silently
registered a vow that he would not cease until he
had avenged her. He gave a short sigh as he
banished his feelings from his mind and became once
more the efficient, unemotional officer from Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>“It’s the girl right enough,” he declared. “Now,
sergeant, as you may have guessed, there is more
in this than meets the eye. I have reason to suppose
that this is neither accident nor suicide.”</p>

<p>“What, sir? You mean murder?”</p>

<p>“I mean murder. As I understand it, this girl
was in the power of a gang of sharpers. She got
to know more about them than was healthy for her
and this is the result. I may be wrong, but I want
to be sure before I leave here.”</p>

<p>The sergeant looked bewildered.</p>

<p>“There is no sign of violence, as you can see,” he
suggested hesitatingly. “And the doctor had no
suspicion of murder.”</p>

<p>“There has been no post-mortem?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. It wasn’t considered necessary.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have one now. Can you get the authority
from your people? It should be done at once.”</p>

<p>“Of course, sir, if you say so it’s all right. There
will be no difficulty. But as a matter of form I must
ring up the superintendent and get his permission.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sergeant, I recognize that. Can you
do it now? I should like to see the doctor as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p>While the necessary authorization was being
obtained French examined the body and clothes in
detail. But except that a tiny bit of the skirt had been
torn out, as if it had caught on a splinter or nail,
he found nothing to interest him.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he and the sergeant were
being shown into the consulting room of Dr. Hills,
the police surgeon.</p>

<p>The doctor was a short man with a pugnacious
manner. To French’s suave remarks he interposed
replies like the barks of a snapping Pekinese.</p>

<p>“Murder?” he ejaculated when French had put
his views before him. “Rubbish! There were no
marks. No physical force. No resistance. Not
likely at all.”</p>

<p>“What you say, doctor, certainly makes my theory
difficult,” French admitted smoothly. “But the
antecedent circumstances are such that murder is
possible, and I’m sure you will agree that the matter
must be put beyond any doubt.”</p>

<p>“No doubt now. Made my examination. What
do you want next?”</p>

<p>“A post-mortem, doctor. Awfully sorry to give
you the trouble and all that, but Superintendent
Hunt agrees that it is really necessary.”</p>

<p>The doctor was full of scorn at the idea. He
had made an examination of the remains in his own
way and that should be sufficient for any layman.</p>

<p>But it was not sufficient for French. He held to
his point and it was arranged that the post-mortem
should take place immediately.</p>

<p>“A word in your ear, Dr. Hills,” French added.
“Keep the idea of subtle murder before you. These
are clever people, these three whom I suspect, and
they’ll not have adopted anything very obvious.”</p>

<p>“Teach grandmother . . . suck eggs,” barked
the doctor, but there was a humorous twinkle in his
eyes at which French could smile back with a feeling
of confidence that the work would be done
thoroughly and competently.</p>

<p>“He’s always like that,” the sergeant volunteered.
“He pretends to be annoyed at everything, but he’s
really one of the best and a dam’ good doctor too.
He’ll make that examination as carefully as the best
London specialist and you’ll get as good an opinion
when he’s finished.”</p>

<p>If time was a criterion, the job was certainly being
done well. French, sitting in the nearest approach
to an easy-chair that the sergeant’s office boasted,
had read the evening paper diligently, had smoked
three pipes, and finally had indulged in a good many
more than forty winks, before Dr. Hills returned.</p>

<p>“Kept you up, Inspector?” he remarked, glancing
at the clock, whose hands registered half past three.
“Ah, well. Been worth it. Found something.
You’ll not guess. No sign of murder. No force
applied. No resistance made. Death by drowning
only. All as I said. <em>But</em>——” He paused in his
stream of explosives and waited impressively.
“But—water in lungs and stomach—<em>fresh</em>, Inspector,
<em>fresh</em>. What you make of that?”</p>

<p>French was considerably impressed.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it yourself, doctor?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Drowned in the sea. Fresh water in lungs.
Pretty problem. Your funeral.” He shrugged his
shoulders, gave a quick, friendly smile, barked
“Night!” and was gone.</p>

<h2>Chapter III. <br/> The Inquest</h2>

<p>The problem with which Dr. Hills had presented
French was not so difficult as it appeared at first
sight. There could indeed be only one solution, but
that solution carried with it the proof of what French
had up to then only suspected, that Thurza Darke’s
death was the result of neither accident nor suicide,
but definitely of murder.</p>

<p>If the water which the poor girl had swallowed
were fresh, it obviously followed that she had been
drowned in fresh water, her body having afterwards
been put into the sea. Why the three fiends had
committed their revolting crime in this way French
did not know, but it was clear that the placing of
the body in the sea could have been done with but
one object—to conceal the fact of murder by creating
the appearance of accident. And had it not been
for the special knowledge which French possessed,
it was more than likely that the trick would have
been successful.</p>

<p>A further problem immediately arose, trifling in
comparison to that of the girl’s death, but still
requiring a decision. Should the discovery be
mentioned at the inquest?</p>

<p>To allow the conspirators to suppose that their
scheme had succeeded would have the obvious
advantage of making them less careful. In the course
of his career French had many times experienced
the value of lulling his adversary to complacency, if
not to sleep.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be difficult to keep
the matter quiet. The doctor would certainly
refuse to hold back such material evidence. This
would involve confiding in the coroner and adjourning
the inquiry on some technical ground, as that
official would not allow a verdict inconsistent with
the facts to be returned. But an adjournment would
not have the effect desired by French. Until the case
was finally disposed of and a verdict of accidental
death returned, the murderers would remain on
tenterhooks, alert and careful.</p>

<p>Eventually French came to the conclusion that it
would be best to let matters take their own course.
At the same time he would try to keep out of the
affair, so that Scotland Yard’s interest in it might
remain a secret.</p>

<p>In this case he would not give evidence of
identity. His decision therefore plunged Sergeant
Golightly into an orgy of telephoning, in order that
the inquest might be postponed until he could secure
the attendance of Mrs. Peters, the deceased girl’s
landlady.</p>

<p>The proceedings opened in the early afternoon.
French had taken his seat amongst the crowd of
loafers and other casuals who invariably attend
such gatherings, and held no converse with the
police. The room was crowded, the affair having
produced a mild sensation.</p>

<p>The first witness was a tall, bronzed man of about
thirty, named Austin Munn. He deposed that he
lived at Lee-on-the-Solent and he was owner of the
schooner yacht <i>Thisbe</i>. At about 6.30 on the
previous morning he and three yachting friends had
started off in the <i>Thisbe</i> for a long day’s sail. They
were going east through Spithead and towards
Brighton. When they were passing through Stokes
Bay, some three or four miles from Lee he saw
something in the water. He was at the tiller and
he altered course to pass it closely. When they came
near they saw that it was the body of a young
woman. They hove to immediately and brought it
aboard. They tried artificial respiration for over an
hour, though none of them thought it would be any
good. The girl looked as if she had been dead for
some hours. The body was that on which the
inquest was being held. They turned into Portsmouth
and on arrival one of his friends had gone to inform
the police. The sergeant had come down at once
and arranged for the removal of the remains.</p>

<p>Sergeant Golightly stated that about 8.30 on the
previous morning Mr. Lewis Pershaw, one of Mr.
Munn’s yachting party, reported that his yacht had
picked up the body of a young woman when starting
out for a cruise. He, Golightly, had gone down and
taken charge of the remains. The deceased was
dressed in a light fawn coat and skirt, with a white
silk blouse, flesh-coloured stockings and black patent
shoes. She had no hat. On her left wrist was a
watch which had stopped at seven minutes past one.
She wore a necklace and ear-rings of imitation
pearls. Her face was calm and peaceful.</p>

<p>As a result of his inquiries he had learnt that the
deceased was a Miss Thurza Darke, an employee
at the Milan Cinema in Oxford Street, London. She
lodged in a boarding house in Clapham and the landlady
was present and would give evidence of identity.
He had been unable to find out how the body had
reached the place in which it was found.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peters was then called. She deposed that
the remains were those of her late lodger, Thurza
Darke. The girl had lived with her for nearly a
year. She was quiet and well conducted, prompt in
payment, and popular with the other boarders. She,
Mrs. Peters, had become quite fond of her and this
tragedy had come as a terrible shock.</p>

<p>Further questions elicited the fact that the witness
believed that her boarder had recently been in some
serious trouble. For the last couple of weeks in
particular she had lost a good deal of her brightness
and seemed to have some worry on her mind. But
she had not said anything on the subject and Mrs.
Peters had not tried to force her confidence.</p>

<p>The witness then told of the telephone call.
Though this had surprised her, never having heard
Miss Darke mention any of her relations, she had
not doubted its genuineness at the time. It was not till
afterwards that she had learnt from the police that
Miss Darke had not sent it.</p>

<p>The fat was then in the fire. When Mrs. Peters
left the box Sergeant Golightly was recalled and
asked if he had made inquiries into the authorship
of the message. His reply that he had ascertained
that it had not been sent by any of the officials at
the cinema was the first hint those present had
received that the case might not be quite so
straightforward as up to then it had seemed. Interest in
the proceedings perceptibly quickened and the
spectators leant forward and fixed their eyes more
intently on the witness. But except to obtain the
statement that Golightly had been unable to trace the
call and had no idea who sent it, the coroner had no
further questions to ask.</p>

<p>Dr. Hills was the next witness. He deposed that
he had at first made an external examination of the
remains, by means of which he had satisfied himself
that the deceased had died from drowning. He gave
technical details as to the condition of the body,
stating that in his opinion death had taken place some
eight to nine hours previous to his inspection. That
had been made about ten o’clock and this, if he was
correct in his opinion, would place the hour of death
somewhere between one and two in the morning.</p>

<p>“That would agree with the time at which the
watch stopped,” the coroner remarked, turning over
his notes. “The hands were pointing to one-seven,
Sergeant Golightly has told us. Now, Dr. Hills,
you said that at first you made an external examination
of the remains. What exactly did you mean by
‘at first’?”</p>

<p>“Last night late police came to my house. Said
they were not satisfied. Had an idea there might
be foul play. Wanted a post-mortem. I made it
with Dr. Carswell.”</p>

<p>“And did you find anything which might be taken
to support their idea?” the coroner asked, while the
recently aroused interest intensified.</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated.</p>

<p>“Found a peculiar fact,” he answered. “Outside
my province to draw inferences.”</p>

<p>“And the fact?”</p>

<p>“Water in the lungs and stomach was fresh.”</p>

<p>The statement produced something in the nature
of a sensation. The faces of most of those present
assumed an expression of bewilderment, but a few
seemed instantly to grasp its significance.</p>

<p>“And what,” went on the coroner smoothly, “did
this fact convey to you?”</p>

<p>Dr. Hills shrugged. “Girl was drowned,” he
declared, “but not in sea. Couldn’t have put herself
into sea. Body must have been put in by someone
else. Least, strikes me that way.”</p>

<p>“Did the remains show any sign of force or
compulsion?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>For a moment the coroner hesitated when he had
written down this reply, his forehead wrinkled from
thought.</p>

<p>“Now, doctor,” he said at last, “you know this
country pretty well, I take it?”</p>

<p>“Lived here all my life.”</p>

<p>“Is there, so far as you know, any river or fresh
water area into which this poor girl could have
fallen and from which her body could have been
carried to the sea where it was found?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know of any.”</p>

<p>Again the coroner hesitated.</p>

<p>“It must be evident to you, Dr. Hills, that your
evidence suggests at least the possibility of foul
play. I want to ask you now, not only from a medical
point of view, but also from your experience as
a man of the world, whether you can suggest any
explanation of the facts other than that of the
murder of the deceased?”</p>

<p>At the ominous word a little ripple of movement
passed over the assembly, followed immediately by
a silence as those present settled down to listen
even more intently. Dr. Hills shrugged again.</p>

<p>“Utmost respect: scarcely my province. Since
you ask: private opinion: girl was murdered.”</p>

<p>“But there is no definite medical evidence for that
view?”</p>

<p>“None. Girl was drowned in fresh water. That
is all.”</p>

<p>The coroner looked round.</p>

<p>“Would any member of the jury like to ask the
witness a question before he stands down?”</p>

<p>A small foxy-faced man like a tradesman or small
shopkeeper rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I would like to ask the doctor just what the police
said to him about foul play, and then I would like
to ask the sergeant just what made him say it.”</p>

<p>“That is an important point and one I have
already noted,” the coroner replied. “Dr. Hills
stated,”—he referred to his notes—“that he was
asked to make a post-mortem, as the police had an
idea there might be foul play. Have you anything
further, Dr. Hills, to add to that statement?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. That covers everything.”</p>

<p>“The nature of the police suspicion was not
revealed?”</p>

<p>“No. Not in detail.”</p>

<p>“And was the doctor not curious? Did he not
ask?” interjected the foxy-faced juror.</p>

<p>The coroner frowned. “The witness has said the
nature of the suspicions was not revealed in detail,”
he said coldly, glancing at the juror. “Were you
told in a general way that murder was feared?”</p>

<p>“In a general way, yes. No details.”</p>

<p>“Who spoke to you on the subject?”</p>

<p>This was the question French was dreading. If
the matter were pressed, there would be nothing for
it but for him to give evidence.</p>

<p>The doctor looked as if he were going to hedge,
then he seemed to think better of it and answered:</p>

<p>“Sergeant Golightly and a representative, as I
understood it, from Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>At this a little ripple of movement swept over
the assembly. From the spectators’ point of view
things were going better and better.</p>

<p>“And it was the Scotland Yard man, I presume,
who promulgated the suspicion?”</p>

<p>“That is so.”</p>

<p>“You may stand down, doctor, but please don’t
go away. Recall Sergeant Golightly. You didn’t
tell us, sergeant, that you had received a visit from
an officer of Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>“You may rest assured, sir, that all the essential
facts would have been put before the court. As you
know, sir, it is not customary for the police to state
the sources of their information.”</p>

<p>“I am not criticizing your conduct, sergeant, nor
do I wish to embarrass your handling of the case,
but if there is further information as to how your
suspicions became aroused which you can properly
give us, we should be glad to hear it.”</p>

<p>The sergeant glanced at French. To the latter
it seemed that less harm would now be done if he
himself gave evidence than if a mystery were made
of the affair. He therefore nodded and the sergeant
replied:</p>

<p>“There is no mystery in the matter, sir. I can
tell you everything that occurred. I admit that no
suspicion of foul play was aroused by the finding of
the body. It seemed to me a case of either accident
or suicide. But that afternoon a call was received
from Scotland Yard, a general call, sent, I understand,
to all stations. This said that a young lady
was missing, giving her description and asking for
a lookout to be kept for her. When I read it I
thought it probably referred to the deceased. I
telephoned so to the Yard and there was a reply that
an inspector would come down by the evening train
to see if he could identify the remains. Inspector
French arrived and did so. He said that the possibility
of foul play must not be overlooked and
suggested that a post-mortem should be made. With
the consent of my superiors the matter was arranged.
Inspector French then told me who the deceased
was and where I should go to get a witness of
identity.”</p>

<p>“Has Inspector French returned to London?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He’s here.”</p>

<p>“Here now? Then call him.”</p>

<p>As French entered the box the little ripple of
excitement was repeated. A full-fledged inspector of
the famous C.I.D. was an unwonted sight in the
local courts and people craned forward to see what
manner of man he might be.</p>

<p>In the meantime French had made up his mind as
to what he would say. He would of course tell the
truth, but perhaps not the whole truth. In such matters
his conscience was a trifle elastic. He justified
his conduct by considering the admirable end for
which his evasions were invariably made.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. French,” the coroner went on when
he had noted the witness’s name and occupation.
“Will you please tell us all you properly can of this
matter.”</p>

<p>“There is not much to tell, sir,” French replied
in his pleasant but respectful manner. “Some time
ago I had occasion to visit the Milan Cinema in
Oxford Street, and I became acquainted with one of
the young ladies in the box office, a Miss Thurza
Darke.”</p>

<p>French, with an admirable air of candour, made a
slight pause as if he had reached the end of a
paragraph. Immediately he went on:</p>

<p>“Yesterday I was again at the Milan, and I
noticed that Miss Darke’s place was empty. I asked
about her and what I was told did not seem quite
satisfactory. As a result I made some inquiries and
learned that Miss Darke had left the Milan at her
usual time on the previous evening, quite in her
ordinary frame of mind and without making any
special remark to anyone there. From Mrs. Peters, her
landlady, who gave evidence here today, I learnt
about the telephone message. The fact that this
message was a false one confirmed my suspicion that
all might not be well, particularly as no reason could
be suggested for the girl’s disappearance. Considering
all the circumstances it was judged wise to issue
a circular that she was missing. This was done and
there was a reply from here, as you have heard. I
came down and saw that the deceased was Miss
Darke.”</p>

<p>“And have you any idea as to how her body
got into the sea?”</p>

<p>“None, sir.”</p>

<p>“What does the fact that fresh water was found
in the deceased’s lungs convey to you, Inspector?”</p>

<p>“Just what the doctor has said, sir; that she was
drowned in fresh water and that her body was
afterwards put into the sea.”</p>

<p>“Can you account for that in any way other than
that the girl was murdered?”</p>

<p>“That is certainly the most probable explanation,
though I think there are others. For instance,
the girl might have been drowned accidentally or
committed suicide and her body might have been
found by someone who feared that he might be
accused of murder and therefore in a moment of panic
tried to get rid of it in a way that he hoped would
keep him from suspicion.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t seem very probable.”</p>

<p>“It does not, sir, but one has to consider all
possibilities.”</p>

<p>The coroner continued asking questions, but
without learning anything further of interest. Then
he turned to the jury and made a short speech.
Having surveyed the evidence he continued:</p>

<p>“The questions which you have now to consider,
gentlemen, are three in number. First, you have to
find the cause of death, if in your opinion the
evidence justifies you in doing so. Now to my mind
there can be no doubt of this. Dr. Hills has told us
definitely that it was drowning. Secondly, you have
to decide whether this drowning was caused accidentally
or whether it was suicide or whether it was
murder. Here the evidence is not so direct. It has
been established, however, that the girl was drowned
in fresh water and the body afterwards placed in
the sea, because apart from Dr. Hills’ testimony,
we all know that there is no river hereabouts into
which the deceased could fall and in that space of
time be carried by the current to where she was
found. It is difficult to see with what object this
could have been done save that of hiding a crime.
If you think that these views are borne out by the
evidence you will return a verdict of wilful murder.
If, on the other hand, you consider some other
explanation tenable, such as the ingenious one
advanced by Inspector French, you may return that of
accidental death. If you consider that the evidence
points to suicide you will find accordingly.</p>

<p>“Your third question follows from the answer you
give to the second. If you find that murder has
been committed you must state, if you can, the guilty
party or parties. As to this it appears to me that
no evidence of any kind has been placed before you.
But here again you must form your own opinion.”</p>

<p>Contrary to French’s opinion, the jury elected to
retire. For half an hour they considered the matter,
then at last brought in the verdict which had
seemed to him self-evident—wilful murder by some
person or persons unknown.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV. <br/> French Makes a Start</h2>

<p>“I should like to introduce you to Major Bentley,
our chief constable,” said Sergeant Golightly to
French as they left the courthouse.</p>

<p>The major was a small dark man with a rather
Jewish cast of countenance. French had noticed
him come in late to the inquest and had imagined he
was a police official.</p>

<p>“I was talking over this affair with the
superintendent this morning,” the major began. “He’s
knocked up at present and I went to his house. That’s
why you haven’t met him. In the absence of complete
knowledge we rather took the view that the
key to the matter lay in London and that Portsmouth
came into it only as the result of an accidental
selection. I should like to know, Inspector,
if that’s your view also?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, it is, sir. I have some
further information which I didn’t think it necessary
to lay before the coroner, but which I should be
pleased to give to you. It tends in that direction.”</p>

<p>The chief constable smiled.</p>

<p>“I rather imagined your evidence was—shall I
say?—bowdlerized. It occurred to me that you were
mighty quick in assuming that the girl had
disappeared. All the details strictly accurate?”</p>

<p>“Strictly, sir.” French smiled also. “But if a
meaning other than that I intended were taken from
what I said, that would not be my fault, would it?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Naturally the energies of the
police must be directed towards hoodwinking the
courts, eh?”</p>

<p>French laughed outright.</p>

<p>“It has its uses,” he admitted, glancing with
amusement at the sergeant’s scandalized countenance.
“But this time I fear our adversaries are too
wide awake to be taken in by it.”</p>

<p>“That so? Well, come along, will you, to the
sergeant’s office and let’s have our chat.”</p>

<p>When they were seated and had lit up three of
the chief constable’s Egyptian cigarettes French told
in detail about his interview with the dead girl and
the inquiries he had already made. Both men listened
with keen attention and without interrupting.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about, Inspector?” Major Bentley
asked when he had finished. “Those three ruffians
get these girls into their power, or try to. But what
for? Have you any theory?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not,” French admitted. “At first it looked
like an attempt to rob the tills of the cinemas, but
all they’d get from that wouldn’t be worth their
while. It might, of course, be for immoral
purposes, but somehow I don’t think so. In any case
the motive for this second murder is clear. This
Style believed that the girl Darke connected him
with the first crime, the murder of Eileen Tucker.”</p>

<p>“Possibly they found out that she had gone to the
Yard and thought she had given them away?”</p>

<p>“That’s my view. Probably they shadowed her.
If so, they would see that her ability to identify three
of their members would make her so dangerous that
their only policy would be to make away with her.”</p>

<p>“Quite. That’s clear enough. But it doesn’t
explain the first murder.”</p>

<p>“It does not, sir. It looks as if there was some
game going on to get the cash out of those cinemas,
but how it would be done I can’t see.”</p>

<p>“Nor I.” The chief constable shrugged his shoulders.
“Well, that’s all very interesting, but the
point about which I really wanted to consult you is
this: If the key to the matter lies in London, as I
think we are agreed that it must, the matter is one
for you and not for us.”</p>

<p>“The body was found here, sir. It is technically
a matter for you.”</p>

<p>“I know, but that is a detail which can easily be
put right. If we apply for help from the Yard you
can sail ahead without delay?”</p>

<p>“That’s true, sir, or at least the Yard can. I
should have to report and wait for orders. But as
I’m mixed up with the case already and as I have
no other job on hand I am sure I should be the man
sent. Shall I get on the phone to the Yard?”</p>

<p>“I think you should. Tell them we’re applying
to the Home Office for help from them, and that
I’ve suggested that as you’re here you might carry
on.”</p>

<p>“Right, sir. I’ll do it now.”</p>

<p>But when French got through to Chief Inspector
Mitchell he was surprised by receiving a recall.</p>

<p>“Come and see me first, French, at all events,”
said his chief. “We’ll fix it up then.”</p>

<p>French travelled to Waterloo by the 8.06 p.m.
from Portsmouth, and early next morning knocked
at the Chief Inspector’s door.</p>

<p>“Morning, French,” Mitchell greeted him.
“I was a good deal interested by the summary of
those proceedings down at Portsmouth. I fancy
there’s more in this thing than we’ve got down to
yet. Just start in and give me details of what took
place at the inquest.”</p>

<p>French obeyed. Mitchell listened without
interrupting and nodded his head when his subordinate
had finished.</p>

<p>“I sat here,” he said slowly, “last night for a
solid hour after I had received your telephone,
trying to remember a name. At last I got it. Does
Arundel convey anything to you?”</p>

<p>“Arundel?” French repeated. “Near Eastbourne
that is, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Eastbourne your grandmother. It’s ten miles
east of Chichester and some four miles from the
coast. That help you?”</p>

<p>French slowly shook his head. “Afraid not, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. Past that little town there
flows a river, the Arun, and in that river one day last
October was found the body of a young woman.
The medical evidence was that she had been drowned
and as there were no signs of violence or other
suspicious circumstances a verdict of accidental death
was returned. But, French,”—Mitchell leaned
forward and became very impressive—“she was
employed in the box office of a big London cinema!”</p>

<p>French stared.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, sir! Another one?”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think? And there’s more in
it than that. This girl, Agatha Frinton, was alone
in the world, at least no relatives could be
discovered; she was living in a boarding house, and the
landlady stated that she had seemed very depressed
for some ten days before her death.”</p>

<p>“It’s another case of the same,” French declared
with an oath. “As sure as we’re alive, it is! Don’t
you think so, sir?”</p>

<p>“It’s certainly suggestive. It looks to me like the
last time your friends wanted a recruit for their
little scheme, whatever it is.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think. It’s going to be a big case,
this. The further you go into it, the bigger it grows.
That’s three girls we believe they’ve murdered and
goodness knows how many more there may be that
we haven’t got on to yet.”</p>

<p>“I have a man on that,” Mitchell declared. “He’s
looking up the files. I told him to go for any cases
of the death of girls in box offices of places of
amusement, including accidents, suicides, and murders.
That should cover it?”</p>

<p>“That’ll cover it all right. But there’s another
point, sir. We believe they murdered Thurza Darke
because they found out that she had been at the
Yard and they suspected she was going to give them
away. Had this other girl, this Agatha Frinton,
been to the Yard?”</p>

<p>“Quite right, French,” Mitchell approved. “I
have a man on that too. He’s making a list of girls
who lodged complaints which might apply. There’s
this girl, Agatha Frinton, and also that other, Eileen
Tucker, to start with. But it doesn’t follow that
they need have actually called here. A first step
might have been what Sherlock Holmes used to call
oscillation on the pavement. They might have come
and looked at the door and their courage might have
failed them at the last minute. But if the gang saw
them do that it might be enough.”</p>

<p>“It would indicate what was in the girl’s mind,”
French agreed.</p>

<p>“Quite. Now there is another thing, French.
Can we learn anything from the geography of the
affair?”</p>

<p>French looked his question.</p>

<p>“Here we have murders taking place at Caterham,
Arundel, and Lee-on-the-Solent. As geography
doesn’t seem to be your long suit, hand over
the atlas and let’s look them up. See,” he went on
when the places had been found, “when you add
London they make a curve: London, Caterham,
Arundel, and Lee: something like three, four, five,
and six on a clock. Anything in that?”</p>

<p>French pondered, then slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, bear it in mind,” Mitchell advised. “Later
it may give you a hint as to this precious gang’s
headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I am to take up the case?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Get right on with it at once.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir. I’ll go round to the cinema and
Thurza Darke’s boarding house again now I’m here,
but I fancy my best hopes are at Portsmouth. There’s
quite a chance that they may have left traces when
they were getting the body into the sea.”</p>

<p>“Quite. It shouldn’t take you long to bring them
in. You’ve plenty to go on. You have the descriptions
of at least three of the gang and you have
these three murders to go into, for I think we may
take it this Arundel affair was part of it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get at it immediately. I suppose,” French
hesitated, “you’ve no idea what they might be up
to?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. Some way of robbing the
cinemas occurs to one at once, but I don’t see how
it could be done on a big enough scale to be worth
while.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought. In fact I don’t see how
it could be done at all.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get an idea before long, I fancy. Well,
get ahead, French. If you get tied up at Portsmouth
you can try Arundel and if you make a mess
of that you can move on to Caterham. Between
them all you should pull the job off.”</p>

<p>French felt a small glow of appreciation for his
chief as he left the room. Mitchell was certainly
a man to work for. He knew his job from A to Z
and his power of getting straight to the heart of
things was little short of uncanny. He was as
straight as they are made and when he could
legitimately do so he always supported his men.
Moreover he made allowances for human weakness and
beneath his somewhat short manner there was a very
real vein of kindliness. French had never met
anyone whom he would rather serve under.</p>

<p>He lost no time in getting to work. Beginning
with the boarding house, he interviewed not only
Mrs. Peters, but the servants and some of the
boarders with whom the deceased girl had been on
specially intimate terms. Unfortunately from them he
learnt nothing. Nor did a meticulous search of Miss
Darke’s belongings give better results. Then he
drove to Mr. Arrowsmith’s office and interrogated
the typist, Jennie Cox. From her he obtained a
good deal of information as to the dead girl’s life,
but again none of it threw light on his present
problem.</p>

<p>By the time he had finished with Miss Cox the
Milan was open and after lunch he went there to
continue his inquiries. Here after considerable trouble
he learned one new fact, not indeed an important
one, but still something.</p>

<p>An attendant whom he had not seen on his previous
visit had been on duty in the entrance hall on
the night on which Miss Darke had disappeared.
About quarter before eleven a young lady had come
in. As the show was nearly over he had wondered
what she wanted and had watched her particularly.
She had gone to Miss Darke’s box and a short but
animated conversation had taken place between the
two ladies. He had overheard the stranger say as
she was leaving: “Cheerio, then. I’ll wait for you
at the corner.” She was a tall, good-looking girl,
stylishly dressed, with a fur coat, and she seemed
eager and excited and as if pleased about something.
The attendant had noticed also that Miss Darke had
hurried away as soon as she could.</p>

<p>In spite of the man’s somewhat meagre description,
French had little doubt of the visitor’s identity.
That she was Gwen Lestrange he would have
bet long odds. He immediately set to work on the
clue. After examining the remainder of the cinema
staff he arranged for the interrogation of the police
who had been on duty in the immediate neighbourhood
on the night in question, and circulated an inquiry
among the taximen of the district in the hope
that the girls might have engaged a vehicle.</p>

<p>The great machine of the C.I.D. having thus been
set in motion in London, he returned at eight o’clock
to Portsmouth. Smoking a meditative after-dinner
pipe in the train, he set himself to take stock of the
facts which he had already learnt and to see if they
would yield any deductions which might indicate the
way in which he should go.</p>

<p>He saw at once that the inquiry resolved itself into
two separate and distinct problems. There was the
immediate question of the identity of the trio who
had murdered these poor girls. For French believed
with his chief that all three crimes were the work of
the same parties. But behind that there was the
further problem of motive. What were these three
people doing that should lead them to so terrible an
expedient?</p>

<p>It did not require much thought to show French
that he must concentrate on the first of these
questions. Until the criminals were discovered the
second question could scarcely be approached. Indeed,
the establishment of their identity might lead
directly to the discovery of their motive.</p>

<p>Of the murder of Thurza Darke therefore, just
what did he know?</p>

<p>She had left the Milan at 11.15 in her usual health
and spirits and her dead body was found in the
Solent at about 7.00 the next morning. The evidence
of her watch tended to the belief that she was
murdered at 1.07 and this was supported by the doctor’s
statement.</p>

<p>French wondered if he could make a provisional
time-table of the happenings on that tragic night.
Again and again he had found that nothing had so
cleared up his views on a case as the fixing of a
duration to each incident. Perhaps in this case also it
would give light.</p>

<p>In the first place he considered the time which he
should allow for the actual murder. Even with his
case-hardened mind he did not care to dwell on the
ghastly details. But he felt sure that it could not
have been completed in less than half an hour. When
he added the time necessary for the kidnapping he
felt sure a good deal longer would have been
required. Assume however half an hour: 11.15 to
1.07, less half an hour was about 80 minutes.</p>

<p>It was evident in the next place that the journey
from London must have been made by car. There
was no train and the difficulties of using an
aeroplane would have been overwhelming. Moreover,
the fastest motor launch would have taken too long
for a sea passage to have been taken.</p>

<p>He had brought a map and guide-book of the
district and these gave the distance from London to
Lee as something like 78 miles. From the above
facts it followed that the crime could not have been
committed at Lee. It must have been done within
an 80-minute journey from London.</p>

<p>In 80 minutes French thought it unlikely that
more than thirty miles could have been done. With
such a freight no driver would have run the risk
of being held up by the police for speeding. Thirty
miles from London in the general direction of
Portsmouth brought him to the district containing
Wokingham, Aldershot, Godalming, Horsham, and
Ashdown Forest. He thought that a provisional
assumption was justified that the murder had been
committed either in London or somewhere on the
London side of this circle.</p>

<p>Some fifty miles had then to be covered. On
these country roads a higher speed might be
admitted. Still French did not believe Lee could
have been reached before about half past three
in the morning.</p>

<p>The remains would then have to be put into the
sea, an operation which would also have taken time.
Suppose it took half an hour. This would have
brought the time to four o’clock. About four it
would be beginning to get light, and French was
sure the criminals would do their utmost to get
away as soon as possible from a place with such
dangerous associations.</p>

<p>When the train ran into Portsmouth station
French was smiling contentedly. He was pleased
with his progress. From nothing whatever he had
evolved the definite concept of a car arriving at a
point near Lee at some time between, say, 3.00 a.m.
and 5.00 a.m. on the morning of Tuesday, the 19th
of June, and of the carrying of the body from this
point to the sea. Possibly a study of the shore and
currents might enable him to fix that point within
short limits. If so, it would be strange indeed if he
did not find some further clues. In a hopeful frame
of mind he put up at the Splendid at Southsea, his
plans for the next day settled.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch05">

<h2>Chapter V. <br/> Lee-on-the-Solent</h2>

<p>When French woke next morning he found a
brilliant sun pouring in through his window. A
good omen, he thought, as he gazed out on a sea
just as blue and sparkling as the Mediterranean had
looked from the hotel in Nice at which he had
stayed when investigating the wanderings of the
Pyke cousins. With luck he would make progress
today.</p>

<p>A short journey through Portsmouth and Gosport
brought him to Lee-on-the-Solent, a pleasantly
situated little town of new houses, stretched out
along the shore. Five minutes later he was turning
in at the gate of Mr. Austin Munn’s neat villa.</p>

<p>There the first instalment of his luck materialized.
Mr. Munn, clad in white yachting flannels, was
reading the paper on a rustic seat in a shady nook.
French went over to him.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Munn, getting up. “You’re the
inspector, aren’t you? Lovely morning. Do you
wish to see me?”</p>

<p>“For a few moments, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Shall we sit here or would you rather
go into my study?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine anything better than this. A
delightful place you have here, Mr. Munn.”</p>

<p>“Not too bad on a fine morning,” Munn
admitted. “Will you smoke, Inspector?” He held
out a gold cigarette case. “Terrible business about
that poor girl.”</p>

<p>“That of course is what I want to see you about,”
French returned, selecting an opulent looking Turkish
cigarette. “The local police have called in Scotland
Yard and I’ve been put in charge of the case.
I want to ask you for some help.”</p>

<p>“Only too glad if I can do anything, but I’ve
already told all I know.”</p>

<p>“I’m in hopes that you can help me all the same.
First I’d like to fix just where you picked the body
up. I have an Ordnance map here and perhaps you
could mark the spot.”</p>

<p>French unrolled the 6-inch map he had brought
from London. Munn bent over it.</p>

<p>“It was about here,” he pointed, “to the east of
Stokes Bay almost off Gilkicker Point.”</p>

<p>“And how far from the shore?”</p>

<p>“A mile, I should say. Not less, possibly more.”</p>

<p>“Here?” French made a cross at the place.
“Now how was the tide running?”</p>

<p>“Flowing, but the current was running out. You
see, we have rather peculiar tides here. The run in
and out doesn’t exactly correspond with the rise and
fall.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that ever obtained.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. It’s caused, of course, by the configuration
of the coast. It’s a bit confusing at first. For
about two and a half hours after high water the
current continues to run up the estuary, though the
actual level is falling. Then for some eight hours it
runs out. Now on that Monday night it was high
water shortly after one o’clock, summer time. After
that the tide level began to fall, but the current was
still running up towards Southampton. About
three-thirty in the morning the current changed and
began to run out towards the sea. Low water was
about seven-thirty on Tuesday morning, but the
current continued to run out for another four hours.
That’s roughly what happens, though if you want
stricter accuracy you would say ‘westerly and
easterly’ instead of ‘up and down the estuary.’ ”</p>

<p>“I think I follow you. At what time did you find
the body?”</p>

<p>“About seven.”</p>

<p>“Then if I have understood you correctly, when
the body was found about seven the tide current was
running seawards, and had been since three-thirty?”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Munn, this is where I want your help.
Rightly or wrongly I have formed the opinion that
the body was placed in the sea at some time between
three and five that morning, most probably about
four o’clock. Assuming that is so, where do you
think it might have been put in?”</p>

<p>History seemed to French to be repeating itself as
he asked the question. It was not so long since he
had sat on the stones at the end of the pier at Burry
Port in South Wales and asked stout Coastguard
Tom Manners how the tides ran in the Burry Inlet
and where a crate which had been found off Llanelly
might have been dropped into the water.<a href="#note2" id="noteref2" class="pginternal">*</a> If
this went on, he thought, he might set up as a tide
specialist. He only hoped that today’s inquiries would
have as satisfactory results as those on that former
occasion.</p>

<p>Like Tom Manners, Munn hesitated over his
answer, whistling the while under his breath.</p>

<p>“I should say,” he replied at last, “a short way
above Lee. Perhaps at Lee, perhaps at Hill Head,
probably somewhere between the two. It’s not easy
to say with any degree of accuracy.”</p>

<p>“That’s good enough, Mr. Munn. You see what
I’m after? If I search the coast where you suggest
I may find some kind of clue.”</p>

<p>Munn shook his head. “I rather question it,”
he answered slowly.</p>

<p>French’s eyes narrowed. “Now just why do
you say that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. It hadn’t occurred to me before,
but your question suggested it. I don’t believe the
body was put in from the shore at all.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“I think it was too far out,” Munn went on.
“I don’t mean that the tide runs exactly parallel to
the shore. It doesn’t. But an object put in at the
shore near Hill Head or Lee would not have got so
far out from the land as the distance to Stokes
Bay.”</p>

<p>French nodded.</p>

<p>“I follow you. You mean that the body must
have been thrown in at some considerable distance
from the shore?”</p>

<p>“Either that or it must have been thrown in
earlier and come down from nearer Southampton.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been much earlier,” French
objected. “Remember the poor girl was alive and
well in London at eleven-fifteen that night.” He
paused in his turn, then went on: “Any chance of
getting a boat along there?”</p>

<p>Munn gave him a sharp glance.</p>

<p>“On compulsory loan? Yes, I believe that would
be possible, Inspector. Several of the residents along
the shore have boats which lie out at night in the
summer. I should think one could be borrowed.
But your criminals couldn’t get any oars. They’re
always taken in when the boats are out of use.”</p>

<p>“That may prove an additional clue,” French
declared. “I’m sure I’m greatly obliged, Mr. Munn.
Thanks to you, my next move is clear. I shall search
this stretch of coast in the hope of finding that a
boat and oars were tampered with. If I am lucky
enough to find them it may lead me on to something
else.”</p>

<p>The day was living up to its early promise as he
took leave of Munn and set off on foot along
the shore. The prospect was charming. Across
the blue, sparkling waters of the Solent lay Cowes,
peeping out behind the Osborne Woods, while
upstream, on the opposite side of Southampton Water,
the long, low coastline rose dark and tree clad from
shore to serrated horizon. The sea was dotted with
the white sails of pleasure craft, and close under
the island a great liner moved rapidly up towards
Southampton. At intervals along the road were
villas, opposite many of which were boats. To
“borrow” one of these during the hours of darkness
should certainly be easy.</p>

<p>But how was he to find out whether or not it
had been done? He could see but one way and that
long and tedious. He must make house to house
inquiries as to whether, first, any trace had been
found of the taking out of a boat, and second,
anyone had been heard or seen on the shore about the
time in question.</p>

<p>Soon he found his premonition justified. A longer
or more tedious job he had seldom tackled. At house
after house he called, waited interminably until some
responsible person could see him, talked that person
into a sympathetic frame of mind and then put his
questions. With one inquisitive and voluble householder
after another he searched boats, investigated
the hiding places of oars and questioned servants. All
to no purpose. Nothing helpful was to be learnt.
He carried on while the day wore slowly away,
growing more tired and dispirited with each fruitless
repetition. At last only one group of houses
was left and he began rather despairingly to wonder
what he would do if he did not get news at one of
them.</p>

<p>But just as he was losing hope the luck turned.
In this case the owner was at home and on learning
French’s business became interested. He had, he
said, been shocked to read of the murder and would
be glad to do anything to bring the criminals to
justice. He at once called the members of his
household that French might put his questions. And when
this led to no result he went down with French to
examine the boat.</p>

<p>It was moored off the end of a slip. A short
painter was made fast to the bight of an endless
rope which passed through pulleys fixed to the end
of the slip and to a pole driven into the beach some
eighty or a hundred feet farther out to sea. This
arrangement enabled the boat to be kept clear of
slip and pole, while by pulling on the rope the painter
could be drawn to the slip. A cord, lapping the
parallel parts of the rope at the pulley, prevented
accidental movement.</p>

<p>The moment the owner, Mr. Farrar, saw this
cord he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hullo! Some one has been here! I never left
that cord like that!”</p>

<p>“No?” French answered, his spirits rising with
a bound. “How did you leave it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know if you know anything about knots,”
Mr. Farrar went on. “If you do you will see that
this is an ordinary clove hitch such as a skilful
landsman might make. Now I always use what is called
a ratline lock. It was shown to me by a Norwegian
sailor whom I once met.”</p>

<p>“Pretty conclusive,” French admitted. “How long
is it since you had the boat out?”</p>

<p>“Must be over a week,” Farrar said. “I have
been in town for the last four days and I am sure
it was four days before that.”</p>

<p>“Very satisfactory. Might we have the boat in?
I should like a look at it.”</p>

<p>Farrar loosened the cord, and pulling on the
rope, drew the boat in to the slip. It was about
twelve feet long and strongly built and wide in the
beam. A good sea boat, French thought.</p>

<p>He got in and began one of his meticulous
examinations. Almost at once his efforts were rewarded.</p>

<p>Caught in a splinter of one of the stern bottom
boards was a tiny scrap—little more than a thread—of
fawn coloured material. It was just the shade
of Miss Darke’s coat and skirt and French had not
the slightest doubt that it would match the slight
tear he had noticed.</p>

<p>“That fixes the matter, I fancy,” he said as he
put his find carefully away in an envelope. “Part
of the dead girl’s skirt. I noticed it had been torn.
Now let’s see if there is anything else.”</p>

<p>Never since it had left the builder’s hands, if
then, had that boat had such an examination as it
got that afternoon. But it contained nothing else
which might form a clue nor could French find any
fingerprints.</p>

<p>This matter of the boat seemed to him to supply
the answer to a question which had puzzled him
from the first. If the criminals’ object had been to
dispose secretly of the body, why had they chosen a
landlocked piece of water like the Solent, particularly
one so alive with shipping? The answer was evident:
the boat. On no part of the open coast could
they find boats so conveniently placed for
“borrowing.” The ease of getting the boat would clearly
outweigh the increased risk that the body might be
found.</p>

<p>He rejoined Farrar on the slip.</p>

<p>“That’s really excellent,” he said with ill repressed
delight. “It shows that I am on the right track.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how finding this will help you.
There is nothing here to indicate who used the
boat.”</p>

<p>French did not feel called on to deliver a
dissertation on the science of detection.</p>

<p>“It may be a help. You never can tell,” was his
summary of the situation. “By the way what about
oars? Where do you keep yours?”</p>

<p>“They couldn’t have got the oars. They are
never left in the boat. We take them up to the
house when we’ve finished with them. The criminals
must have stolen oars elsewhere or brought
their own.”</p>

<p>“One other question. You’ve told me you didn’t
see anyone about on that Monday night or hear a
car. Now can you suggest anyone who might
possibly have been out?”</p>

<p>Farrar shrugged.</p>

<p>“How could I?”</p>

<p>“Well, who are the doctors in this part of the
world? Was there a dance in the neighbourhood?
You see what I mean?”</p>

<p>Farrar saw, but couldn’t help. He gave the
names of four medical men, any one of whom might
have been called in by residents in the district. But
he didn’t know of anyone who had been. And then
suddenly he slapped his thigh.</p>

<p>“But I do though, after all,” he exclaimed. “Findlay’s
wife had a son that morning! You bet Findlay
was out for the doctor. You should go and see him;
he’s an architect in Portsmouth. Or if you like you
can come back to the house and ring him up. I’ll
introduce you.”</p>

<p>French accepted gratefully and in a few minutes
the call was put through. Findlay was equally
ready to help. Yes, his wife had been confined on
the night in question and he had gone for the doctor
shortly before four—Dr. Lappin, of Lee. But he
had met no one on the road nor had he seen a car.</p>

<p>“A call on Dr. Lappin seems to be indicated,”
French declared as he once again thanked Farrar
for his help.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the latter with a sidelong look,
“since you mention it, do you know why I told you
about Findlay?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“For this reason. I know something about the
police and I may tell you that you’re the first officer
who has ever come to ask me a question in what I
may call a really civil way. It is generally: ‘Tell me
or it’ll be the worse for you.’ But when you treated
me as a friend who might be able to help you, why,
I thought I’d do it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think our people are as bad as you make
out, Mr. Farrar. But I’m much obliged to you all
the same.”</p>

<p>After a hurriedly snatched cup of tea French
presented himself at Dr. Lappin’s door. The doctor
was just going out, but he turned back with his
visitor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed, “I left here shortly after four.
It is about five minutes’ run to Mr. Findlay’s and I
should say that I got there about four-fifteen.”</p>

<p>“And did you notice a car?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact I did. Now let me see where
it was. Yes, I remember it distinctly. It was about
half a mile on the Hill Head side of the wireless
station, where the road turns inland. I can show you
the very place if you wish me to.”</p>

<p>“It passed you there?”</p>

<p>“I passed it. It was standing at the side of the
road and the driver was working at the engine. He
had the lid of the bonnet raised and was bending
over it. I slowed up and called out to know if
there was anything wrong, but he replied only a
dirty plug and that he had got it right.”</p>

<p>This was good news. French felt that he was
on the trail once more. With his interest aroused
to the keenest pitch he went on with his
questions.</p>

<p>“There was only one man there?”</p>

<p>“I saw only one. The car was a fairly large one,
a saloon. It was not lighted up and there might
have been others inside, but I didn’t see anyone.”</p>

<p>“Was there a moon?”</p>

<p>“No, but dawn was breaking. I could see objects
fairly clearly, but no more.”</p>

<p>“Now, what about the man outside? Could you
describe him?”</p>

<p>“Not well. He was muffled up in a coat and had
a soft hat pulled down over his eyes. As far as I
could see he was a tallish, thin man with a pale face
and small moustache. But I couldn’t be sure of
that.”</p>

<p>“Anything peculiar about his accent?”</p>

<p>“It occurred to me that he had a sort of inflexion
in his voice such as you hear in Ireland or South
Wales. I don’t know about North Wales, as I’ve
never been there.”</p>

<p>“High pitched or low?”</p>

<p>“Rather high of the two.”</p>

<p>Better and better! If this was not Style, French
would, so he said to himself, eat his hat.</p>

<p>“I see. Now, doctor, can you describe the car
more fully?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t think I can, except that it was a
middle-sized, grey saloon. Possibly a Daimler,
though really I have no right to give such an
opinion. But it seemed rather that shape. Of
course that’s the shape of a lot of other makes as
well. But I saw the number.”</p>

<p>“The number! Why, sir, you did well. What
was it?”</p>

<p>The doctor smiled thinly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t deserve as much credit as you
seem to think,” he protested. “It happened to be
the number of my own car, less one figure. Mine is
7385 and this one was 7395—one figure different,
you see. But whereas my car is registered in
Hampshire, this one had a Surrey initial.”</p>

<p>“This is valuable information, Dr. Lappin,”
French declared. “Now before I go do you think
there is anything else that you can tell me? You
didn’t see anyone on the road, for instance?”</p>

<p>But Dr. Lappin had not noticed anyone. The
facts he had mentioned he was sure of, but he knew
no others. When he had returned about seven the
car was gone. He promised French to give any
evidence that might be required and that in the
meantime he would say nothing of what he knew.</p>

<p>On his return to Portsmouth French drafted a
police circular. It was believed that a middle-sized,
grey saloon car, possibly a Daimler and possibly
registered in Surrey and numbered 7395, had travelled
from London to Lee and back during the night
of the 18th/19th inst. Had anyone seen or heard
of such a vehicle? Three persons were believed to
have been in the car—here followed descriptions of
Westinghouse, Style, and Gwen Lestrange. Had
these persons been noticed? Had anyone been seen
taking out or replacing a boat between Lee and Hill
Head during the same night?</p>

<p>From the police station French went to interview
the coastguards, but unfortunately without result.</p>

<p>Delighted with the result of his first day’s work,
he went early to bed and slept the sleep of the weary.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch06">

<h2>Chapter VI. <br/> The Supreme Appeal Court</h2>

<p>Though self-congratulation is not precisely the
same as pride, common experience teaches us that
it is usually followed, if not by a fall, at least by a
disappointment. French’s satisfaction at his rapid
progress was no doubt natural, but its sequel proved
an illustration of this unhappy principle.</p>

<p>After his first day’s achievement there followed a
period of stagnation. It was not that he did not
show energy and industry. On the contrary no one
could have done more. Rather was it as if the
Fates disapproved his frame of mind and withheld
the success which his efforts deserved.</p>

<p>And yet the second day began well. On reaching
the Portsmouth police station the next morning news
was awaiting him, news moreover which at first sight
seemed valuable enough. Shortly before four on the
morning of the crime a motor car resembling in every
respect that described in his circular was seen
passing through Titchfield in the direction of Lee. It
was driving fast, but not fast enough to provoke the
interference of the constable who observed it. There
being nothing to call the man’s special attention to
it, he had unfortunately omitted to note its number.
But he had noticed on the left running board an
object some four or five feet long by six inches in
diameter, tied up in canvas and not unlike a bag of
large golf clubs.</p>

<p>A second report had come in from Fareham. At
about five or a little later a similar car had passed
through the town. It had been seen twice, first
approaching from the direction of Gosport, and a
few moments later leaving on the road towards
Bishop’s Waltham. Both the men who had seen it
believed that it contained two persons besides the
driver, and both had seen the canvas package.</p>

<p>That this car had carried the body of the murdered
girl, French had little doubt. It was true that
Dr. Lappin had not observed the package. But
French believed that this was for the excellent
reason that when the doctor passed the car it was not
there. For he felt sure that he knew what that
package contained. In this carefully planned crime
the murderers knew that though they could “borrow”
a boat there would be no oars in it. French
had little doubt that beneath the canvas cover lay
a pair of oars divided into two by some form of
socketed joint.</p>

<p>After it had left Fareham the car seemed to have
vanished into thin air. In spite of French’s most
persistent inquiries no further trace of it could be
found. Nor did a single one of the vast army of
men who were on the lookout ever identify anyone
as a possible actor in the terrible drama.</p>

<p>The clue of the car number had also petered out,
though as French had not expected much from it he
was the less disappointed. Inquiries had shown that
the car bearing the number seen by Dr. Lappin
belonged to a well-known Surrey resident of
unimpeachable character. There was moreover ample
proof that the car had been in the owner’s garage
during the entire night of the crime.</p>

<p>As soon as he was satisfied that every agency
which could be directed towards the tracing of the
car or the gang was working at highest pressure,
French went down to Arundel and made exhaustive
inquiries into the tragic death of Agatha Frinton.
But though he was untiring in his efforts, he found
out nothing more than the local police had already
reported.</p>

<p>After a week of fruitless work he transferred
his activities to Caterham. Here almost immediately
he learned an interesting fact. On the third
night before the discovery of the tragedy there had
been a dance. One of the guests’ homeward way lay
past the quarry hole in which the body of Eileen
Tucker had been found. There, at about three in
the morning he had passed a car standing at the
side of the road, the driver bending over his engine.
He had stopped and asked if anything was wrong
and the man had replied that it was only a dirty
plug and that he would have it changed in a few
minutes. But though the night was calm he had not
heard the car start. Unfortunately he could not
describe the driver, except to say that he was tall and
spoke with a rather high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>These facts tended to confirm French’s theory
that the crime was the work of the same trio as were
guilty in the Portsmouth case. But beyond that they
helped him not at all. No further trace of the car
or its occupant could be found.</p>

<p>Then ensued a period of waiting, heartbreaking to
French. In spite of his own efforts and those of
his army of helpers no further facts were discovered.
No irregularities had taken place in connection with
the box office cash at any London cinema. No box
office girls had left unexpectedly. Day after day
French had to report failure, and each day Chief
Inspector Mitchell shook his head and looked grave.
“We must get them,” the Chief would say. “If we
don’t some other poor girl’s death may lie on our
consciences.” To which French could only reply
that he knew it, but that everything he could think
of was being done.</p>

<p>The strain began to affect his nerves and it must
be admitted that not infrequently “Soapy Joe” was
anything but saponaceous in manner. Mrs. French
soon noticed it and it annoyed her.</p>

<p>“What on earth’s bitten you, Joe?” she asked one
evening when absent-mindedness and short answers
were all that she could extract by a thrilling tale
of the next door neighbour’s servant’s delinquencies.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said French.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she repeated scornfully. “Don’t tell
me a pack of lies. You’ve had something on your
mind for the last fortnight. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Well,” French admitted, “I suppose it’s this
confounded case. I don’t seem to get any forrader
with it. I should have had those three people long
before this and I can’t get a line on them anywhere.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was that. Now, I’ll tell you what
you’ll do. You’ll put the thing out of your head
and take me to the Palladium. Then when we come
home I’ll make some tea and you’ll tell me the whole
story. Telling it like that will perhaps clear it up
in your mind and you’ll see how to get on.”</p>

<p>French did not often bring his business into his
home or discuss his cases with his wife. But on
certain occasions when he had felt utterly up against
it he had put his difficulties before her in detail, and
it had not seldom happened that she had made some
remark or thrown out some suggestion which when
followed up had led him to his goal. He remembered
particularly one case when she had practically
told him the solution of a problem which he himself
had been utterly unable to imagine—that worrying
conundrum of the identity of the mysterious Mrs. X
in the Gething murder case of Hatton Garden.
Suddenly a wave of hope flowed over him. Perhaps in
this case also she would, as he put it, “take a
notion.”</p>

<p>With a sudden recrudescence of his old energy he
jumped to his feet, crossed the room and implanted
a whole-hearted and resounding kiss on the good
lady’s cheek.</p>

<p>“Bless you, Em,” he cried. “You’re not such a
bad old sort. We just will. Come along.”</p>

<p>They went along; he, throwing off his depression
and in better heart than he had been for many days,
enjoying the programme, laughing unaffectedly over
the jokes; she, saying little and caring nothing for
the show, but full of a tender maternal feeling for
this great child in whom all her life was centred.</p>

<p>When they reached home she made the promised
tea, but French with amazing sleight of hand managed
to transform his portion into a glass of whisky
and hot water during its passage from the kitchen.
He was not a drinker, but occasionally of an
evening or if he met a friend he would take what he
called “half a peg.” This evening somehow seemed
to require some such form of celebration.</p>

<p>For, illogical though it might be, he had suddenly
become wholly optimistic. Far more than he realized
he was building on the chance of his wife’s “taking
one of her notions.”</p>

<p>Presently they began to discuss the affair, she
seated and bending over a piece of sewing, he on
his feet and moving restlessly about.</p>

<p>“I don’t see, Emily, that I can tell you very much
more about it,” he declared. “I explained it to
you before. There have been no fresh
developments since then.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” she returned as she drew back her head
and looked critically at her work. “Then tell me
again.”</p>

<p>Pacing slowly up and down the room, French
retold the whole story: the call from Arrowsmith,
the interview with Thurza Darke, the checking up
of the girl’s story, the appointment in the National
Gallery which she failed to keep, the search for her
and its tragic end at Portsmouth, the crimes at
Arundel and Caterham, and lastly the means which
were still in operation to find the criminals.</p>

<p>To all this she seemed to pay but scant attention,
eyes and fingers being concentrated on her
work. From her manner French never could tell
whether she was really listening to him or not,
though afterwards he usually found she had grasped
every detail. When he had finished he waited
eagerly for her comment. But she still remained
silent, folding and tacking the corners of her work
with apparently no thought for anything else in
the world. At last however she spoke, and as her
remark took the form of a question, his hopes
bounded up.</p>

<p>“You think those three poor girls were all
murdered by the same people?” she said slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you?” he answered. “All three were
employed——”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Mitchell thinks so too?”</p>

<p>“Certainly he does. You see, if——”</p>

<p>“And both you and Mr. Mitchell think that they
were murdered because they got hold of the secret
of this gang?”</p>

<p>“To all intents and purposes, yes. We can’t tell
whether the girls actually knew the secret, but they
knew enough to be dangerous. We think Thurza
Darke may have been followed to the Yard.”</p>

<p>Mrs. French slowly threaded her needle, giving
to the operation immense thought and care. Then
as if once again able to attend to trifles, she went
on:</p>

<p>“If you’re right in that, it follows that these
three are up to some pretty serious business. If they
would sacrifice three lives to preserve their secret
it must be a pretty dangerous or a pretty valuable
one?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, Emily. There can’t surely be
any doubt of that?”</p>

<p>French was feeling slightly disappointed and a
trifle irritated. This was not like his wife. He had
hoped for something more illuminating. But he
was not prepared for her next question.</p>

<p>“Have they stopped it?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Eh?” he returned. “Stopped it? Why, that’s
just it. We have no reason to think so. And that’s
what’s bothering us most of all. If some other poor
girl——”</p>

<p>“Because if they haven’t stopped it it must still
be going on.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s going on, or at least we think
so,” he said impatiently. What did she mean by
harping on with these obvious facts? “What’s in
your mind, Emily? I don’t see what you’re after.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s going on now, that should surely
give you all you want.”</p>

<p>“All I want?” He stared at her with a sudden
thrill. Something was going to come out of this
after all! “For heaven’s sake, Emily, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. French was not to be hurried. Deliberately
she rearranged her work and started on a
new corner.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that Darke girl upset when you saw
her?” she went on slowly.</p>

<p>“Very much so. She thought she——”</p>

<p>“And she had been upset for some time before
you saw her?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She thought those ruffians Westinghouse
and Style were——”</p>

<p>“And those other two girls? They were upset
too before they disappeared?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I found that both had evidently had something
on their minds for a considerable time. The
people at their boarding houses and at the cinemas
had noticed it. But how does that help? It only
means that all three knew they were in a tight place.”</p>

<p>“It means far more than that. It gives you all
you want so far as I see.”</p>

<p>French swung round in his walk with a gesture of
impatience.</p>

<p>“For the love of heaven, Emily, can’t you say
what’s in your mind? How does it give me
anything?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to let you think for yourself.
You’re not shining just at present, Joseph
French.”</p>

<p>He recognized “her way.” Exasperated by it,
but thrilled by the possibility of some light really
coming, he answered eagerly: “Don’t worry about
me, old lady. Get on and let’s have the big idea.”</p>

<p>“Surely it’s simple enough. Cinema box office
girls are necessary to this thing, whatever it is.
All the girls whom you found mixed up in it showed
unmistakable signs of being upset. The thing is
still going on. Other girls will therefore be mixed
up in it. These girls will therefore be upset. Well,
find them.”</p>

<p>For the second time that evening French strode
over to his wife and implanted a hearty kiss on her
cheek.</p>

<p>“By Jove, old girl, but you lick creation! It’s
an idea, that is. Quite an idea.” He swung up and
down the room, enthusiastic, then hesitated as a
wave of misgiving swept over him.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>The phrase about marriage being the domestication
of the Recording Angel passed inconsequently
through his mind. He hoped his Emily didn’t
<em>always</em> read his thoughts as he answered:</p>

<p>“When those first two girls were put away some
crisis in the gang’s affairs must surely have arisen.
When the business is running normally they may not
be upset at all. It may be running normally now.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s running normally there won’t be any
more murders, which is what you say you want to
guard against,” she answered drily. “If murder
is threatened the girls will be upset and that’ll give
you warning. Don’t go out of your way to <em>make</em>
difficulties.”</p>

<p>It was his only chance. As he lay awake that
night thinking over the conversation and viewing
his wife’s suggestion more soberly than in his first
flush of delight, he felt that, while unpromising, it
offered at least a possibility of progress. At all
events he decided that next morning he would begin
to work on the idea.</p>

<p>He found his new quest a more difficult job than
he had anticipated. There was no use in asking
the managers of the various London cinemas whether
any of the girls under their charge had lately
displayed signs of hidden anxiety. So long as the
work was done, the managers would neither know
nor care. He must in some way observe the girls
themselves.</p>

<p>But this was no more easy. It was out of the
question for him to scrape acquaintance with all the
cinema box office girls in London. It would take
him a year. There must be some quicker way.</p>

<p>At last he decided that inquiries from the door
porters was his most promising plan. Accordingly
he spent some days going round the cinemas. At
each he drew the most likely looking man aside and
pledged him to secrecy.</p>

<p>“I may tell you,” he began confidentially in each
case, “that I am a detective from Scotland Yard and
that I am looking for a certain girl who has got into
the hands of a gang of crooks. You will understand
that it is not the girl personally that we’re
after, but the crooks. Got that?”</p>

<p>The men got it without difficulty.</p>

<p>“We don’t know who the girl is, but we know two
things about her. First, she is employed in the box
office of a London cinema, and second, because of
her association with the crooks she will be
considerably worried and troubled.</p>

<p>“Now I can’t go round all the box office girls in
London to see if they are showing signs of mental
trouble. And that is where you come in. You know
the girls in your box office. I want you to tell me
whether any of them have become worried looking
lately as if they were in some trouble. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Upon this the idiosyncrasies of the various men
came out. Some were satisfied with the story and
immediately gave an intelligent answer. Others
required further explanation and much questioning and
suggestion before risking an opinion. Still others
were suspicious and gave French a lot of trouble
before he managed to get their views. Lastly, some
were simply stupid. Of these he could make little.</p>

<p>At last after immense labour he obtained the
names and addresses of eleven girls, all of whom,
according to the porters, seemed to be in trouble of
some kind.</p>

<p>His next business was to find out the cause in each
case. Here again the problem was horribly
difficult. No doubt it could be done by scraping
acquaintance with each and in time forcing a
confidence. But French had not time for such methods.
He had spent long enough on the case as it was, and
Mitchell was beginning to hint that he would not
stand for his remaining on it much longer.</p>

<p>He began by sending a man round the addresses.
Five of them were boarding houses. Other things
being equal, he believed the gang would select girls
from boarding houses. They had done so before
and the reason was not far to seek. Girls who were
alone in the world were more defenceless and easier
prey than those who had a family behind them.
Therefore it would be wise to start with these five
girls.</p>

<p>Calling at the boarding houses in turn when the
girls would be on duty, he asked to see the
landladies.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to trouble you,” he began in each case,
“but I am making some inquiries about Miss Dash,
who, I understand, lives here and is employed in the
Asterisk Cinema. I advertised recently for a cashier
for my business and she has applied. She seems suitable
except for one thing. She gives me the impression
of being very depressed and melancholy, as if
something were preying on her mind. Now I would
not care for a girl of that kind. I called therefore
to ask whether you could tell me if her depression is
temperamental or whether it is caused by some
passing trouble from which she is likely to recover.”</p>

<p>Like the porters, the landladies reacted differently
to this stimulus. One accepted French’s statement
without hesitation and replied volubly that Miss
Dash was the best and brightest of girls, but that
owing to the recent death of her young man she
was temporarily below her usual form. Another
was circumspect, but allowed French to understand
that it was believed that the course of true love was
not running as smoothly as it might be desirable. A
third was even more discreet, regretting that she
was not in the confidence of her young ladies, while
the remaining two evidently assumed sinister designs
on French’s part, and would give nothing away.</p>

<p>He realized that he had not gained much from
his visits. Even the first two girls were not out
of the running, as were they in the clutches of the
gang, they might easily have invented the stories
told by their landladies in order to prevent suspicion
attaching to their manner. But this was not likely
and French decided that he would first investigate
the lives of the other three, those about whose
depression their respective landladies would not talk.
These were Miss Lillian Burgess of the Cosmopolitan
Cinema in the Haymarket, Miss Molly Moran
of the Panopticon in Leicester Square, and Miss
Esther Isaacs of the Venetian in the Strand. It
wasn’t perhaps very likely, but from one of these he
<em>might</em> learn something.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch07">

<h2>Chapter VII. <br/> Fair Passengers</h2>

<p>Once he had decided his course of action, French
was not the man to let the grass grow under his
feet. On that very same evening on which he had
learnt of the existence of the three box office girls,
he began his investigation into their lives.</p>

<p>His first move was to warn his helpers, Sergeants
Carter and Harvey, for duty at nine o’clock.
Promptly at the hour the trio sallied forth from the
Yard and turned their steps in the direction of the
Haymarket.</p>

<p>“It’s in connection with that Portsmouth
murder,” French explained as they walked. “I want
three girls shadowed. We’ll do one each. But I
want each of you to recognize all three, so we’ll go
round first and I’ll point them out.”</p>

<p>The façade of the Cosmopolitan blazed with
coruscations of flaming lights as they ascended
the marble steps to its doors. Just inside stood
French’s friend, the porter.</p>

<p>A word from French and he pointed to the pay
box over which Miss Lillian Burgess presided.</p>

<p>“Girl in this box is Number One,” French
whispered, then going to the window he put down a
pound.</p>

<p>“Three stalls, please.”</p>

<p>The girl dropped out the three metal disc tickets
and rapidly laid a ten-shilling note and a shilling on
the ledge.</p>

<p>“Could you spare me silver?” French asked her.
“I’m short of change.”</p>

<p>Without replying, Miss Burgess took back the
note and replaced it with a small pile of coins.</p>

<p>The whole transaction was a matter of seconds,
yet in the time each member of the trio had
carefully observed the young woman and impressed her
features on his memory. As they passed into the
auditorium and out again into the street via the
bar each could have creditably passed an examination
as to her face, dress, and to some extent,
manners.</p>

<p>“Now for Number Two,” said French.</p>

<p>They repeated their proceedings at the gorgeous
Panopticon in Leicester Square, where, unknown
to the lady herself, they made the acquaintance of
Miss Molly Moran. Then they went down to the
Strand and similarly “met” Miss Esther Isaacs at
the Venetian.</p>

<p>“That’s all right until shortly before eleven,”
French declared. “I want each of these girls
followed home. If they meet anyone get his or her
description. I’ll do the Cosmopolitan, Carter the
Panopticon, and Harvey this place. Here are the
girls’ addresses. As soon as they get home you may
drop it for the night. But I’ll want you at
eight-thirty in the morning at the Yard. We’re carrying
on tomorrow.”</p>

<p>The three men separated. Harvey suggested that
as they were in the cinema they might as well see
the programme, and settled down to enjoy himself.
Carter was not on for pictures and went to look up
a friend who lived close by, while French, feeling
restless and unsettled, set off for a stroll through
the crowded streets.</p>

<p>Though a Londoner, French could never get over
his wonder at the streets, especially at night. The
blazing lights, the flashing sky signs, the endless
streams of vehicles on the polished asphalt surface
of the roadway, the sauntering or hurrying crowds
on the pavements, the life and movement and yet
the orderliness, the surprising silence of it all, struck
him afresh as one of the wonders of the world. In
Paris and other cities he had visited they had the
life and the movement, but compared with London
the streets were filled with the blare of a thousand
noises, while the traffic seemed to rush chaotically
in every direction. But here it was as if some great
machine were functioning, quietly, efficiently,
inexorably.</p>

<p>The air was mild and pleasant as he crossed
Trafalgar Square and reached the comparative
solitude of the Mall. He sat down on one of the seats
to rest after the fatigue of the day, smoking
placidly until time, acting through the hands of his
watch, called him back once more from refreshment
to labour. Then knocking out his pipe he
returned to the Haymarket and took up his stand
behind one of the great vestibule pillars of the
Cosmopolitan. From here he had a good view of
the door by which, according to the porter, Miss
Lillian Burgess invariably left.</p>

<p>Soon he saw her. She tripped out and ran rapidly
down the steps in the direction of Piccadilly
Circus. French, hurrying after her, was just in
time to see her disappearing into the tube station.
He sprinted forward, picking her up among the
crowd, and kept behind her as she took a south-bound
Bakerloo train. From the next compartment
he kept her in view, and when she passed out of
the Elephant station he was within twenty feet of
her. She led the way down New Kent Road,
straight to her address in Theobald Street.</p>

<p>As far as that evening was concerned, therefore,
he had drawn blank. He did not think she would
reappear that night, so after waiting on chance for
a few minutes, he went home.</p>

<p>After interviews with Carter and Harvey next
morning, at which he learned that their experiences
had been precisely similar to his own, the shadowing
was resumed. As the three girls did not begin work
until one o’clock and were kept late at night, it was
unlikely that they would be early risers. Nevertheless,
French was leaving nothing to chance and before
nine he and his lieutenants were at the scenes
of their various labours. In French’s case there
was a rather shabby restaurant across the road from
Miss Burgess’ boarding house and there, hidden
behind the dilapidated window blind, he toyed with
breakfast and watched the street. But he had to
read the paper very thoroughly and smoke a number
of pipes before he saw his quarry. No less than
two hours passed before she left the house and
walked in a leisurely way down the street. French
in an even more leisurely way walked after her.</p>

<p>She went straight to Westminster Bridge Road,
crossed the river, and passing through into Great
George Street, entered St. James’s Park. At a steady
pace she crossed the Mall and the Green Park and
reached Hyde Park. There she went up one side
of the Serpentine, round the top of the Bayswater
Road, and down the other side to Hyde Park
Corner. French had fallen far behind, but when he
saw her start off along Piccadilly he closed up and
kept about twenty feet off. She led him along
Piccadilly to the Circus, then turning down the
Haymarket, she disappeared into the Cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that he had been expecting
some such <i>dénouement</i>, French swore. There was
his whole morning gone and nothing to show for it!
He had an accurate knowledge of where the young
lady had taken her morning exercise, but that was
all he had learnt. It looked as if he was on the
wrong track and that this girl at least had no
connection with the gang.</p>

<p>But such had not been proved. It would require
a much longer and more detailed investigation to
set the point at rest. Shrugging his shoulders, he
went back to the Yard to hear how Carter and
Harvey had fared.</p>

<p>He overtook Harvey at the door. Miss Isaacs
had spent her morning in a very similar way to Miss
Burgess. She had left her boarding house about
eleven and gone for a walk. Harvey had kept her
in sight during the whole period and was satisfied
that she had not communicated with any other
person.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Carter came in. Molly Moran
had left her boarding house in Nelson Street, a small
street running between High Street and Arlington
Road, at 11.30. She had taken a Hampstead and
Highgate train at Mornington Crescent station and
had travelled to Charing Cross. On emerging from
the station she had strolled slowly about, first under
the Southern Railway bridge, and then up and down
Craven Street. Carter had had considerable difficulty
in keeping her under observation without
revealing his objective. But he had imagined that
she was waiting for someone and had not let her
out of his sight for a moment.</p>

<p>After about ten minutes a grey saloon car had
come quickly down the street, and pulling in to the
pavement, had stopped beside Miss Moran. She
had immediately jumped in and the car had swung
off towards the Strand. Carter had raced for a taxi.
By a stroke of luck he had got one without having
to go to the rank under the bridge and when he had
reached the Strand the grey car was still in sight,
circling Trafalgar Square. But his luck had then
given out. In the press of traffic his taxi had been
held back, and by the time it had got free the
quarry had disappeared up Cockspur Street. After
fruitless attempts to find it, Carter had driven to
Leicester Square and taken up a position from which
he could watch the doors of the Panopticon. In
some forty minutes Miss Moran had arrived, walking
slowly. As it was then twenty minutes to one,
Carter had assumed that she would not again leave
the building, and had returned to the Yard.</p>

<p>“What was the number of the car?” French
asked.</p>

<p>“MX1382. As far as I could see it answered
the description of the one you heard of in
Hampshire.”</p>

<p>French nodded.</p>

<p>“I was going to ask you that. Did you see
anyone in it?”</p>

<p>“Only the driver. I couldn’t see him clearly
through the glass, but he seemed a big, stout,
clean-shaven man. He wore a soft felt hat; looked like
grey, but I couldn’t be sure of the colour.”</p>

<p>“Did the girl get in beside him?”</p>

<p>“No. She didn’t seem to speak to him, but jumped
in behind and he drove off at once. The thing seemed
arranged and they hurried it through as quickly
as possible.”</p>

<p>This hurry seemed significant to French.
Moreover, the driver was suggestively like Thurza
Darke’s description of Westinghouse.</p>

<p>“Same thing tonight and tomorrow morning,” he
said to his satellites, “only that we’ll change round.
We don’t want those girls to spot that they’re being
shadowed. You, Carter, can take the Isaacs girl
and Harvey, Miss Burgess and I’ll shadow this
Molly Moran.”</p>

<p>That night the three young women went quickly
home as before and next morning at nine o’clock
French found himself trying to kill time
unostentatiously in Nelson Street until Miss Moran should
take it into her rather pretty head to sally forth
on the day’s adventures. There was here no
convenient restaurant and he found himself hard put
to it to keep an eye on the boarding house without
attracting the attention of the curious. But French
was an expert at his job, and by buying innumerable
boxes of matches and cigarettes at the neighbouring
tobacconists and making indefatigable inquiries
for one Mrs. Entwhistle, a mythical dressmaker
whom he had invented for the occasion, he
contrived to fill in the time.</p>

<p>At just half past eleven, the same hour as on the
previous day, the young lady in question emerged
from the boarding house and turned her unhurried
steps towards Mornington Crescent tube station.
Again she took a south-bound train. French
expected that she would alight at Charing Cross as
before, but she nearly gave him the slip by jumping
out of the train just before it started from the
Strand. However, he managed to follow her and
when she reached the courtyard of the main line
station he was not more than ten yards behind.</p>

<p>Determining that he should not be left in the
lurch like Carter, he engaged a taxi, telling the
driver to follow the young lady in blue. The man,
allowing himself the suspicion of a wink, started
off as if the following of pretty young women was
a matter in which he had considerable experience.
Whether or not this was so, he performed his task
with practised skill, stopping at times to adjust his
engine or ask a direction or to allow French to buy
a paper, so as to keep his speed down to that of
his quarry’s.</p>

<p>The chase led across the Strand and up Chandos
Street, and there at the quiet end next Bedford
Street the previous day’s performance was repeated.
Miss Moran walked slowly up and down until
suddenly a grey saloon car appeared, drew in to the
footpath beside her, and stopped. It was driven
by an elderly, clean-shaven man of the successful
American business type. So far as French could see
it contained no one else. Miss Moran stepped
quickly forward and got into the tonneau and
immediately the vehicle slid away.</p>

<p>“Follow the car,” French told the driver.</p>

<p>The journey was short. From Chandos Street
the grey saloon turned up Bedford Street and into
Garrick Street. There it stopped and Miss Moran
got out. Immediately it drove quickly away.</p>

<p>“After the car,” cried French. “Never mind
the girl.”</p>

<p>But just as Carter had been held up on the previous
day, so now French’s luck deserted him. The
grey car, passing along Cranbourne Street, just
crossed Charing Cross Road when the officer on
point duty closed the road and French was held up.</p>

<p>Seeing that to follow the car was out of the question,
he was about to shout to his man to try to find
the girl again, when glancing through the back
window, he saw her approaching. He therefore paid
his man off and when she had passed, slipped out
of the taxi and followed her.</p>

<p>But she merely walked on aimlessly through the
streets, evidently killing time, until some forty
minutes later she reached Leicester Square and turned
into the Panopticon.</p>

<p>French walked slowly back to the Yard, pondering
over what he had seen. The whole proceeding
was certainly very suggestive. He didn’t believe
there could be any innocent explanation. Something
shady, he felt sure, was in progress.</p>

<p>Next morning he had another try. This time
he waited at Mornington Crescent and picked up
Miss Moran as she was entering the train. He
followed her to Charing Cross, where she changed
and took an east-bound Circle train to the Temple.
There she got out, and turning away from the river,
began pacing up and down Norfolk Street. French
hailed the first taxi he saw, and instructing his man
as before, sat back in it to await events.</p>

<p>In about five minutes he saw the proceedings of
the previous day repeated. The grey car appeared,
driven, as far as he could see, by the same man.
It picked Miss Moran up, crossed the Strand, and
passed up Aldwych and into Kingsway. Then turning
down a street to the left, it ran into Wild
Street. There the young lady got out.</p>

<p>French had told his driver what to expect, and
as the grey car ran on into Drury Lane, French’s
vehicle was close behind. Through Broad Street
and High Street it passed and then along Oxford
Street to North Audley Street, down which it turned.
And then in Grosvenor Square the whole thing was
repeated.</p>

<p>On the footpath in Grosvenor Square stood a
young woman. French could not see much of her,
but he noticed that she was well dressed and that
her bobbed hair was flaming red. The car stopped,
she jumped into the back seat, and once again the
car swung on.</p>

<p>More interested than ever, French continued the
chase. The grey car passed on down South Audley
Street and along South Street into Waverton Street.
There it stopped and the girl got out, the car turning
on down Charles Street.</p>

<p>For a moment French hesitated as to which of his
two quarries he should follow. He would have
given a good deal not to have been playing a lone
hand at that moment. Rightly or wrongly, he decided
on the car.</p>

<p>Once again to his amazement a similar scene was
enacted. From Charles Street the car ran by Berkeley
Street, Piccadilly, Grosvenor Place, and Vauxhall
Bridge Road to Tachbrook Street. There another
girl was waiting who in her turn jumped into
the back of the car. She was driven through
Bessborough street to Grosvenor Road, and set down
at the end of Page Street.</p>

<p>Still another time French followed the car and
still another time the same thing happened. A
fourth girl was picked up in Darwin Street, off the
Old Kent Road and near Bricklayers’ Arms goods
station. She was taken to Long Lane in Bermondsey
and there set down, while the car went on to
Newington Causeway.</p>

<p>French began to wonder if the whole day was
to be spent in giving rides to girls. It was now
nearly one, the hour at which most of the cinemas
opened, and if the girls picked up were engaged in
cinema box offices there would scarcely be time to
deal with any more. With keen interest he settled
back in his taxi, anxious to learn the next
development.</p>

<p>But this fourth girl, it turned out, was the last.
The grey car ran on westwards till it reached
Waterloo. Then it turned to the left into York Road and
again to the right into a narrow street labelled
Tate’s Lane, disappearing finally into a gateway
about half-way down the street. French’s car ran
on past the gateway, and turning into the cross
street at the end of Tate’s Lane, stopped. Telling
his driver to keep him in sight, French walked back
to the corner and watched the gateway.</p>

<p>He had noticed as he came past that the latter
was surmounted by a signboard bearing the legend:
“Thos. Cullan, Coachbuilder.” A glimpse through
the open gate revealed a dilapidated yard in which
stood a number of carts and lorries. Evidently Mr.
Thos. Cullan was not in too successful a way of
business. French wondered if the man he had
shadowed was Cullan himself. At first he thought
not. That untidy, ineffective looking yard did not
accord with the forceful, decided face of the driver
of the car. Then he saw that if the business with
the girls was the serious factor in the man’s life,
coachbuilding might be merely a blind to mask his
other activities.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes or more French hung about
the corner. Then the man appeared, well dressed
and prosperous looking, and set off striding with
assured steps down the Lane to York Road. He
turned to the right into Waterloo Road, and French
had to sprint at his highest speed to avoid losing
him at the corner. He was just in time to see him
disappearing into the station and with a rapidly
increasing sense of satisfaction he followed him to
the restaurant.</p>

<p>At opposite ends of the big room French and his
quarry lunched, then the chase was once more
resumed. This time the trail led down Waterloo
Road, past the Old Vic and into Webber Street,
where the man vanished into a doorway.</p>

<p>French hung back until he thought the coast was
clear, then lounged forward and entered also. The
doorway led into a dilapidated passage with a flight
of stairs rising at the end to offices above. On the
jambs were the names of the occupants. Seven
persons or firms French counted. There were two
solicitors, an estate agent, an engineer and architect,
a commission agent, a wholesale tea merchant,
and a firm of electrical suppliers. Having noted the
names, French passed back to the street and took
up a position from which he could keep the entrance
in view.</p>

<p>For the best part of an hour he waited, sitting in
his taxi for the most part, while the driver busied
himself with his engine. Then suddenly the quarry
reappeared and strode off in the same forceful and
determined way. French shadowed him to Waterloo
and down to the Bakerloo tube. Booking to
Watford, which he thought should cover any journey
that the unknown might make, French followed
him to the platform. The man took a north-bound
train and French, slipping in his usual way into the
next carriage, settled down to await developments.</p>

<p>At Harrow the man got out. French noted that
he was evidently a “season” and a man of some
standing, for the ticket collector touched his cap
respectfully. He turned out of the station on the
down side of the line and set off towards the Hill.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if that is Mr. Pointer?” French
asked the collector as he gave up his own ticket.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Mr. Welland is his name.”</p>

<p>Curtice Welland, Commission Agent, was one of
the names on the office door in Webber Street. So
far, so good.</p>

<p>On these comparatively deserted roads shadowing
was no easy task. French had to drop a long way
behind to avoid attracting his quarry’s attention.
Every time the man turned a corner French was
therefore at a disadvantage and had to run to reach
the cross-road before the other disappeared from
view. This again brought him too close and he had
suddenly to loiter until the necessary distance again
intervened—a by no means unobtrusive mode of
progression.</p>

<p>The last turn led into a recently made road. Its
end, in fact, vanished into the fields and fresh
earthwork showed that it was in process of being
extended. The houses along it were all quite new.
Several were unfinished, while a few vacant building
lots still remained.</p>

<p>About half-way down on the right were a couple
of small semi-detached houses, mere bungalows. Into
one of these the man turned, letting himself in with
a latchkey.</p>

<p>French was approaching a cross lane, and down
this he immediately turned. So far he felt satisfied
with his progress. The man, he was sure, had not
seen him. Now he must find some cover from which
he could keep the house under observation.</p>

<p>Right at the end of the unfinished portion of the
road, a couple of hundred yards beyond the house,
he had noticed a small clump of low growing trees.
He thought if he could reach this it would suit his
purpose.</p>

<p>Passing down the cross lane to the back of the
row of houses, he came into open fields. These
were separated by thorn hedges, one of which ran
parallel to the street. French crept along behind
the hedge until he came to the clump. There he
found that, while himself completely hidden from
view, he had an excellent view of the house.</p>

<p>He lay down at his ease on the soft grass, and
taking out his pipe, began a leisurely smoke. It
was a perfect summer’s day, warm and balmy, with
a bright sun, a brilliantly blue sky and in the distance
a few faint, fairy-like streaks of cirrus cloud. The
meadow behind him had recently been cut and the
soft breeze bore a delightful scent of fresh hay. The
air was quivering with the songs of birds, with as a
pedal base the hum of innumerable insects. It was
all so peaceful and soporific that after a few minutes.
French deliberately sat up in a somewhat strained
position lest he should fall asleep and miss his
quarry.</p>

<p>Up to the present he had been too busy to think
over what he had seen, but now he began to turn
the facts over in his mind. That he was on to
some very peculiar happenings there could be no
doubt, but as yet there was no evidence to show that
these were criminal. Still less was there proof that
they were connected with the murders. But he was
at least satisfied that the affair was sufficiently
suspicious to warrant further investigation.</p>

<p>What, he wondered, could be going on? It looked
as if the unknown man had an interview each day
with each of these four girls. This, of course, was
not proved, as you could not argue to the general
from two days’ experience. But it seemed likely;
and if so, what could be the object of these
interviews?</p>

<p>It was improbable, he thought, that the man
could be interested in the girls themselves. Rather
he imagined that they must represent channels by
which something was passed between the man and
still other unknowns. Whether that something was
material, such as stolen goods or money, or whether
information was being conveyed between the
members of some organization and headquarters, he
could not imagine. In any case it was desirable that
Scotland Yard should know more about it.</p>

<p>It would not be his fault, he resolved grimly, if
before long Scotland Yard did not know all there
was to be known.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch08">

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br/> The Grey Car’s Round</h2>

<p>The remainder of that day came to French as a
sort of anticlimax. He put in a wearisome afternoon’s
work with, so far as he could see, no result
whatever.</p>

<p>After some half hour in the clump of trees he
suddenly saw his man appear at the door of the
house, wearing plus fours and with a bag of golf
clubs over his shoulder. He turned towards French
and when he reached the end of the road, struck off
along a footpath across the fields. This brought
him near French’s retreat, not so near as to risk
discovery, but near enough to allow French to fall
in behind him with the minimum of trouble.</p>

<p>The chase lasted for nearly a mile, the unknown
striding easily along as if he enjoyed the walk. At
last they reached the links for which the other had
been aiming. Welland disappeared into the
club-house, emerging a few minutes later with a
companion. The two strolled to an adjoining green,
teed off and in a leisurely way followed the balls.</p>

<p>That a round of golf offered a favourable opportunity
for the interchange of small objects or of
confidences between conspirators French was well
aware. He therefore hesitated as to whether he
should try to keep the men in view with the object of
seeing whether they acted suspiciously and of learning
the identity of the partner. Eventually he
decided that the game would probably prove to be a
side issue and that he would be better employed in
finding out as much about Welland as he could.</p>

<p>Returning to Harrow, he called at the police
station and asked the sergeant for information.</p>

<p>“I can’t give you much, I’m afraid, sir,” the man
answered, “but if you can wait a little I’ll make a
few inquiries.” He called a subordinate. “Here,
Colgate, you know that man Curtice Welland, of 39
Acacia Avenue? Isn’t his housekeeper a local?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Sister of Jacques, the confectioner.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. Then go down to Jacques and
pick up anything you can about Welland. Quietly,
you understand. Or would you rather go yourself
Mr. French?”</p>

<p>“No,” said French, “I’m supposed to be shadowing
the man himself. I left him on the links and
I’ll get back there.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir. Nothing wrong, I hope?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. He’s been acting suspiciously,
but it may not amount to anything. Well, sergeant,
I’ll call in later on for your man’s news.”</p>

<p>Arming himself with a packet of raisins and
chocolate, French returned to the approach road to the
golf links and settled down to wait his man’s
appearance. It was nearly seven before he saw him
and then the earlier proceedings were reversed.
French shadowed him back to his house along the
path over the fields. Once more French hid in the
clump of trees and once more he settled down to
watch.</p>

<p>Fortunately the magnificent day had turned into
an equally delightful evening or French’s lot would
have been less pleasant than it actually proved. Hour
passed after hour and Welland made no sign.
Hungrily French consumed the last fragments of
his raisins and chocolate and slowly smoked pipe
after pipe. As it grew dark he left his retreat and
drew nearer and nearer the house. But his man
remained hidden and when half past ten arrived he
decided that nothing more was to be learned that
night and gave up his vigil.</p>

<p>On his way back to town he called at the police
station to learn the result of the pumping of
Jacques. It had not proved very successful. All
that the sergeant had discovered was that Curtice
Welland had come to the neighbourhood some
twelve months previously, buying the house in which
he lived. He was believed to be well to do, for
though he had some job in town and went in every
day, he was able to get home early and to play a
lot of golf. Apparently he was unmarried, at least
no woman other than his elderly housekeeper had
been seen about the place. He lived a retired life,
going out but little in the evenings and doing
practically no entertaining. He took no part in the
public life of the place, but was understood to be
popular among the golfing set and to be generous in the
matter of subscriptions to charity. So far as the
sergeant knew he was not connected with any
church or other local organizations. He went to
town daily by the 9.17 train and usually returned
about four.</p>

<p>With this French had to be content. Admittedly
it did not back up his suspicion that the man was a
criminal. But he reminded himself that if a criminal
were wishing to lie low he would comport himself
in just such a way.</p>

<p>Next morning French had three helpers, Carter,
Harvey, and a third man called Pickford. At 9.17
they boarded the Bakerloo train at Harrow, having
first seen Mr. Curtice Welland seat himself in a
first-class carriage. They were close behind him when
he left the train at Waterloo and separately followed
him to his office in Webber Street. There he
disappeared while the four made themselves as
inconspicuous as possible, French engaging a taxi to
wait within call.</p>

<p>About eleven their man appeared and strode off
in his slightly important, prosperous-looking way.
He followed the route he had covered on the previous
evening until he reached York Road and Tate’s
Lane. The coachbuilder’s yard gate was open and
he turned in and was lost to view. French and his
helpers thereupon got into their taxi and making
a circuit through the neighbouring street drew up
at the far end of Tate’s Lane, ready to follow the
saloon car should it make its appearance.</p>

<p>For half an hour they waited, which suggested to
French that Welland did his own chauffeuring. Then
the grey car came slowly out of the yard and turned
towards York Street. Immediately the taxi
followed. The chase led northwards. Over Waterloo
Bridge it passed into the Strand, and turning to the
right through King William Street, led into Orange
Street. There the proceedings of the previous day
were repeated. On the footpath stood Molly
Moran. The car drew in opposite her, she stepped
into the tonneau, and the car drove off. It turned
into Whitcomb Street, crossed Coventry Street, and
in Wardour Street stopped. Miss Moran got out
and it drove on.</p>

<p>French’s bewilderment was reflected in the faces
of his companions as the taxi followed. This thing,
whatever it was, happened day after day and was
apparently carried out on a definite system. For
four consecutive days Welland had picked this girl
up in his car, carried her for a few hundred yards,
and set her down again. Each day it was in the
same part of London, but in a different street. What
could the object be?</p>

<p>As on the previous day the car now drove westward.
Its second stop had then been in Grosvenor
Square. This time it stopped in Berkeley Square,
five minutes’ walk away. There the girl with the
red hair was waiting. She jumped in and two
minutes later, in Grafton Street, jumped out again,
while once more the car drove off.</p>

<p>“Now, Carter, your shot. Follow her,” French
directed, and Carter, slipping out of the taxi,
vanished.</p>

<p>The third girl, who had been picked up in Tachbrook
Street on the previous day, was waiting in
Rochester Row, scarcely five minutes away. She
had a three-minute run, alighting in Regency Street.
As she walked off Harvey slouched after her. Then
the car crossed the river and stopped for the fourth
girl in Upper Grange Road, again close to
Bricklayers’ Arms station. She and Sergeant Pickford
got out five minutes later, while French cautiously
trailed the car back to Tate’s Lane and Mr. Curtice
Welland from there to his lunch and then to his
office.</p>

<p>Shortly before three Welland reappeared and
walked, precisely as on the previous day, to the tube
station at Waterloo. After a momentary hesitation
French, on seeing him enter the Harrow train, gave
up the chase. He thought he could do better
elsewhere.</p>

<p>He returned to Webber Street, and mounting the
stairs, took quick stock of his surroundings. The
house was five stories high and on each upper floor
were two sets of tiny offices. “Curtice Welland,
Commission Agent” was housed on the third floor,
with “Harold Tozer, Engineer and Architect”
opposite. The whole place was dirty and dilapidated
and suggestive of unprofitable businesses.</p>

<p>French approached Welland’s door and knocked.
There was no response. Guardedly he examined the
lock. It was old and he thought it might prove
amenable to the persuasion of a bent wire. But
obviously he could not attempt any burglarious
exploits at the moment, even if sounds of movement
in the engineer’s office had not warned him off.</p>

<p>For a moment he paused, then crossing the landing,
he knocked at the engineer’s door. A lanky
young man opened.</p>

<p>“Sorry to trouble you,” French apologized, “but
I am looking for a Mr. Fairchild, an engineer. I’m
afraid I’ve been misdirected. Do you by any chance
know him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the young man, “there’s no one of that
name here. Sorry I can’t help you.”</p>

<p>French replied conventionally and retreated down
stairs. He had obtained the look at the occupant of
the engineer’s office which he had wanted. Moreover,
he had seen enough to convince him that the
young man was alone.</p>

<p>Once again he took up his weary vigil in the
street below. For nearly an hour he killed time
before he saw his new acquaintance leave. Then he
quickly re-entered the building and climbed to
Welland’s office.</p>

<p>With considerable misgiving he had determined
to do a dangerous and prohibited thing—to search
the premises without a warrant. He felt sure he
could do so without discovery. The whole of the
floor itself was unoccupied, and the wooden steps
of the stairs would give plenty of notice of
anyone’s approach. Unless some extraordinarily
unfortunate accident should bring Welland himself
back, he should be quite safe.</p>

<p>As an additional precaution he knocked once more
on both Welland’s and Tozer’s doors. When he
had waited a moment he clattered down stairs, then
creeping silently up again, he took his bent wire
from his pocket and set to work on the lock. In
a very few minutes it yielded to his treatment, and
passing softly through the door, he closed it behind
him.</p>

<p>The room was fitted up in the barest way as an
office. In the centre stood a roll-top desk with an
Austrian bentwood chair behind it. A second chair
faced the desk. In one corner was a cupboard of
painted deal. And that was all. There was not
even a blind on the window, nor a waste-paper
basket. And the second room was entirely empty.</p>

<p>The doubt of the commission agency business
which all this suggested was increased by a rapid
search of the desk. It contained only some financial
newspapers, a notebook with records of stock and
share transactions, and a number of novels of the
more modern and intellectual type. The cupboard,
which was not locked, was empty.</p>

<p>In spite of the speed at which French worked,
his search was amazingly thorough. Every leaf in
the notebook was turned over and its contents
examined, every novel was gone through lest letters
or loose sheets might have been left between the
pages, the walls and floor was examined for secret
hiding places. In short, when he concluded that
there was nothing in the rooms to interest him, it
was because he had made absolutely certain of the
fact.</p>

<p>Only once had he had a bad moment, when
he had heard laboured steps ascending the stairs.
Silently he had withdrawn to the inner room, in the
hope that even were it Welland, he might still
escape discovery. But the steps had passed on to one
of the offices above, and again breathing freely, he
had resumed his work.</p>

<p>In his withdrawal also he was fortunate. Having
looked round to make sure that no signs of his visit
remained, he drew the office door silently after him,
and gained the street unseen.</p>

<p>It was by this time after six o’clock and French
felt that he had done enough for the day. But
he went back to the Yard, not only as a matter of
routine, but to receive the reports of his three men.</p>

<p>For the first time since he returned from Portsmouth
French felt a sudden thrill of delightful excitement
as he listened to these reports. It looked
as if at long last he really was on the right track.
For each of the three girls was employed in a box
office!</p>

<p>The red-haired girl, it seemed, worked in the box
office of the Royal Cinema in Edgware Road and
the other two in those of Theatres in Vauxhall
Bridge Road and Old Kent Road respectively.
Each had walked from the point at which she had
been set down to her place of business, directly or
by a circuitous route as was necessary to bring her
there at the required time. None of them had held
any communication with any other person during
the walk. In each case the shadower had found
out his quarry’s name, but not her address, as all
three men were afraid of calling attention to their
activities by too persistent questioning.</p>

<p>“Well,” said French, “get back again this
evening and shadow them home.”</p>

<p>Though French himself had been looking forward
to a quiet evening in the bosom of his family, his
eagerness was now so great that after supper he
sallied forth once more to try to push the case a
step further. After considerable trouble he succeeded
in obtaining interviews with the managers of
all four places of amusement—the two cinemas and
the two theatres. To each he explained his official
position, and having made it clear that nothing was
suggested against the girls personally, he put his
questions.</p>

<p>But as he had foreseen, the managers were not
helpful. None of them had noticed anything abnormal
or suspicious in the conduct of the girl in
his company’s employment, nor had there been any
irregularity about her cash.</p>

<p>Next day French carried his routine inquiries a
step further. Armed with the addresses which his
three assistants had discovered on the previous
evening, he interviewed the landladies of the three new
girls’ boarding houses. In each case he was assured
that the girl in question had been in evident
trouble during the previous six months. But the
landladies did not think it was financial. At least
none of the girls had shown a difficulty in meeting
her bill.</p>

<p>The result of these inquiries left French more
than ever determined to probe the affair to the
bottom. But when he came to consider this next step
he found it was not so obvious. At last he decided
to get hold of the girls one by one, and try to force
a confidence. This of course had the serious drawback
of being a virtual warning to the gang that the
police were on their track, but he could see no other
way that held out so promising a result.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch09">

<h2>Chapter IX. <br/> French Makes a Second Assignation</h2>

<p>About ten o’clock the next day French knocked
at the door of No. 27 Nelson Street, and sending in
a card inscribed “Mr. Joseph French,” asked if he
could see Miss Molly Moran.</p>

<p>He sat waiting in the plain, somewhat comfortless
sitting room until after some minutes the girl
he had shadowed entered.</p>

<p>“Miss Moran?” he asked, with his pleasantest
smile. “My business will not take long. Will you
sit down, please?”</p>

<p>She was a prettier girl than he had realized.
Rather below middle height, she had a graceful
figure, with small shapely hands and feet. Her hair
and eyes were dark, her nose tilted delightfully,
while a stubborn little chin showed she had no lack
of character.</p>

<p>“First,” French went on in low tones, glancing
at the door, “I must tell you that I am a detective
officer from Scotland Yard,” and he handed her
his official card.</p>

<p>He was accustomed to seeing apprehension appear
in the faces of those to whom he made this
announcement, both innocent and guilty, but he was
not prepared for its effect upon Miss Moran. For
a moment an expression of absolute terror twisted
her features. Her eyes dilated and her face
became a chalky white. Then with an obvious effort
she pulled herself together and murmured “Yes?”</p>

<p>“You were expecting a visit of this kind, were
you not?” French went on. “You felt that sooner
or later it must come?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no,” she cried hoarsely, but with
delightful suggestion of an Irish brogue.
“Whatever do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I think you know. If you didn’t, why should my
visit terrify you?”</p>

<p>“I am not terrified,” she declared in tremulous
tones which belied her words. “Why should you
think a thing like that anyway?”</p>

<p>“How can I think anything else, Miss Moran?
There is no use in your taking that line. Your
manner leaves no doubt of your feelings.”</p>

<p>She made a determined effort to pull herself
together.</p>

<p>“Well,” she retorted with more confidence, “and
can’t you understand that the very appearance of a
detective gentleman like yourself would be enough to
frighten anyone?”</p>

<p>French shook his head.</p>

<p>“It won’t do, Miss Moran,” he said, not
unkindly. “You apprehend danger to yourself from
my call. You cannot deny anything so obvious. But
I want you to understand I’m not here to harm you.
You have some information that I require. That
is all.”</p>

<p>She waited without speaking, evidently in no way
reassured.</p>

<p>“First,” went on French, still speaking in low
tones, “my business is private. Are you sure we shall
not be overheard? If there is any chance of that I
shall ask you to come out with me and we can
discuss the matter on a seat in one of the parks.”</p>

<p>She nodded quickly. “That’d be better,” she
agreed. “If you go on, I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>French rose. “Right then. What about the
Charing Cross Gardens near the Villiers Street
entrance?” He remembered that this was where poor
Thurza Darke had met Westinghouse.</p>

<p>To his delight the shot told. She gave him a
quick, terrified glance as she faltered: “I’ll be there
in half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Good.” Then loudly for the benefit of anyone
who might be listening. “Well, good-bye, Miss
Moran. I’m glad to have had the pleasure of
meeting you.”</p>

<p>He had little doubt that the girl would keep her
appointment, but he was not so sure that she would
not first communicate with some member of the
gang. Therefore as soon as he was out of sight of
the house in the direction she would expect him to
take, he turned quickly down a side street, and by
making a short detour, regained Nelson Street on
the opposite side of the boarding house. Stepping
into a shop, he laid a shilling on the counter and
asked if he might use the telephone.</p>

<p>“Scotland Yard speaking,” he called softly.
“Please keep a note of any calls from Gerrard 4763C
during the next few minutes. Official demand to
your headquarters following.”</p>

<p>He had noticed the telephone in the hall of the
boarding house. Luckily for him it was one of those
old-fashioned instruments which bore a plate with
the words “Your number is——,” followed by the
digits in question.</p>

<p>He left the shop quickly, so as to make sure that
Miss Moran should not give him the slip. She had
not appeared, and once more becoming an aimless
lounger, he watched the boarding house door.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes she emerged and set off down
the road. Slowly French followed. But she attempted
no excursions aside and within a minute of
the time appointed they met in the Gardens.</p>

<p>“Here is an empty seat,” French said, when he
had gravely complimented her on her punctuality.
“Do you smoke?”</p>

<p>She accepted a cigarette, which he lit in silence,
only continuing when she was comfortably settled.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Moran, you mustn’t be alarmed, but
I have to tell you this is a serious matter that you’ve
got mixed up in. And I may tell you too that your
only chance of keeping out of personal trouble is to
be frank with me. If you tell me everything, I’ll do
my level best for you. But I assure you that I’m
not threatening when I say that if you mislead me
you’ll bitterly regret it.”</p>

<p>The girl had evidently been thinking during her
walk, and she replied with some show of assurance.</p>

<p>“Och sure, Mr. French, I wouldn’t dream of not
being frank with you. But there’s nothing I have
to tell.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear you say so,” French returned,
“because your face shows me the exact opposite.
However, pass that for the moment. Will you tell
me why you travel every morning for a few
hundred yards in Mr. Curtice Welland’s car?”</p>

<p>The girl’s white face paled still further, but she
made no reply.</p>

<p>“Do take my advice, Miss Moran,” French went
on earnestly. “I may tell you in confidence it is
not you that I want, but Welland. But if you
persist in putting me off you’ll be in the same
trouble yourself. Believe me, you’re playing a more
dangerous game than you know.”</p>

<p>For a few moments further she hesitated, then
said sullenly:</p>

<p>“I’m not doing anything against the law.”</p>

<p>“In that case, Miss Moran, you can’t have any
real objection to telling me all about it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t make me say a single word if I don’t
want to.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly true. But I can arrest you on a charge
of criminal conspiracy with Welland and certain
other parties, and the public prosecutor will make
you tell in open court at your trial.”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t do a thing like that?” She
spoke half coaxingly, but the look of fear flashed
again in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Not if you didn’t force me to.” French leant
towards her and spoke very earnestly. “Don’t you
make any mistake, Miss Moran. It’s my business to
get this information and I’m going to get it. And
what’s more, you’re going to give it me. You can
please yourself whether you do it now or at Scotland
Yard or at the Old Bailey. But you’re going to
give it to me.” His voice became coaxing in its
turn. “Why not now, just privately here between
the two of us? I promise to help you and to
protect you from your accomplices.” He paused,
then as she did not speak, went on: “Do be
sensible, Miss Moran. You’ll never get such a chance
again. Remember, it would be a hundred times
worse in open court with everyone against you.”</p>

<p>French felt that he was sailing rather near the
wind in speaking in this way. His justification to
himself was that he was convinced of the girl’s
innocence, or rather that if guilty of crime, she had
been terrorized into it and wished to escape. But
he was not in a position to say this to her in so many
words. He remained silent for a few minutes, then
just as he was about to resume his arguments, she
spoke, her emotion accentuating her brogue.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s a fair way you’re speaking
to me at all,” she said in a low tone, “but how am I
going to stand up against the whole British police?
Sure I see that you’ve got me and I’ll have to tell
you what you want to know.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, you won’t regret it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if you must know, it’s about money,”
she began with a rush, as if, having decided to speak,
she was now only anxious to get her recital over.
“I’ve been hard up for money. And you’ll be
saying it’s very wrong and foolish of me, but I’ve
taken to gambling to raise the wind. That Mr.
Welland is a bookmaker. He has a scheme by which
you can stake on the tables at Monte Carlo, and
you here in London all the time. A girl I met told
me about it. That’s what I’m doing in the car.
Mr. Welland said it was against the law to bet in
the street and that his office was too far away, so
he would lift me for a moment in his car while he
took the money.”</p>

<p>French could scarcely restrain a chuckle of sheer
delight as he listened to this statement. It was even
more gratifying news than that the girls with whom
Welland was dealing were employed in box offices.
For here was actual proof that he really was on the
right track. The scheme for betting on the Monte
Carlo tables connected the cases. When therefore
he was investigating the affairs of Curtice Welland,
he was on the way to learning who murdered
Thurza Darke and her fellow victims. For the
second time in two days he experienced that
delightful feeling of enthusiasm which came from
progress and success.</p>

<p>At the same time he was puzzled by the girl’s
manner. Experience told him that a true confession
produced symptoms of relief. But Miss Moran had
shown no such feeling. Indeed, she seemed more
uneasy and apprehensive than ever. Gradually an
opinion crystallized in French’s mind. He had not
heard the truth. This story was an invention and
the girl was terrified lest he should see through it.
A small test, however, should settle the matter.</p>

<p>“Gambling may or may not be wise, Miss
Moran,” he said gravely, “but it is certainly not
illegal and you have nothing to fear from the police
because of it. There surely must be something else.
Has your betting tempted you towards the till of
the Panopticon?”</p>

<p>For a moment an indignant denial seemed imminent,
then a fresh idea appeared to dawn on the
girl’s mind and she checked herself.</p>

<p>“Maybe there was something of the kind,” she
said, averting her face as if from shame. But
French was certain she was now feeling relief.</p>

<p>So the little test had worked, and out of her own
mouth the girl stood convicted. French’s previous
inquiries had proved that she was not stealing from
the till. But she had seen that her story lacked
motive and to bolster it up she had admitted a theft
of which she was innocent.</p>

<p>The business, then, was even more serious than
he had supposed. This girl was willing to risk
arrest rather than reveal it. But French saw that for
the moment he would get no more out of her, and
he set himself to dispel her fears, so that the story
she would almost certainly tell to Welland would
do as little harm as possible.</p>

<p>One other point, however, he did learn. At the
moment he did not appreciate its importance, but
afterwards he saw that its discovery formed an
essential link in the chain by which he eventually
unravelled the mystery.</p>

<p>While going over with Miss Moran the places at
which she had been picked up and set down, he
remembered that she had not been seen to speak to
Welland, and asked how she knew where to wait
for the car. Without hesitation she told him that
five different places had been chosen, which were
used in rotation. This avoided stopping at the same
point each day, which might be noticeable, and the
number five insured a different place being used on
the same day of each week.</p>

<p>“For example,” she said, “today I’ll be waiting
for him at the corner of Old Compton Street and
Greek Street and he’ll run me to Green Street.
That’ll give me three or four minutes to fix up about
the stakes. Tomorrow I start again where you saw
me first, and so on.”</p>

<p>From such slight threads are the webs of justice
woven!</p>

<p>Before parting with her French became the heavy
father. He told her he was satisfied that she was
doing something which she would be wiser to leave
alone, and though of course she was a free agent,
he urged her for her own sake to give it up. At
all events, if she found herself in any danger or
difficulty she was to apply to the Yard, when he
would see that she got the help she needed.</p>

<p>“And don’t wait till it’s too late,” he concluded
earnestly. “I don’t want to frighten you, but I
warn you very seriously to be careful. Keep this
interview secret from Welland. You may be
in real personal danger if you don’t. Other girls
in your position have been indiscreet and have paid
for it with their lives—I’m not exaggerating, Miss
Moran—<em>with their lives</em>. So keep your mouth shut
and if you are in any danger don’t hesitate to ring
up the Yard—Victoria 7000.”</p>

<p>She seemed considerably impressed as she gave
him her promise. But she had kept her secret and
French, despondent over his failure, told himself
that his efforts had done nothing more than to put
the conspirators on their guard.</p>

<p>He wished her good day, and returned to the
Yard. There he sent for no less than five men.</p>

<p>“Three of you men get yourselves up as taximen,”
he told them, “and take out cars. The other two
and myself will be your passengers. You will stop
in sight of the corner of Old Compton Street and
Greek Street and watch for a grey saloon car lifting
a girl. All of you follow this car. Drive as near
it as possible and watch every motion that the girl
makes. See if she speaks to the driver and if
possible lip-read what she says. After she is set down
in Green Street you are finished and can come back
to the Yard.”</p>

<p>This programme was carried out. When Molly
Moran appeared at the end of Greek Street three
cars were standing before offices in different parts
of the street. On the appearance of Welland’s car
they started up their engines, and as he moved off
they followed. One was slightly in front with its
occupant watching out of the back window by means
of a periscope, a second was almost abreast, while
the third ran on ahead to Charing Cross Road,
ready to fall into place as Welland turned the
corner.</p>

<p>French’s three drivers showed immense skill in
manœuvring their vehicles into places of vantage.
During the whole period in which Miss Moran
remained in the car, an observer was never more than
ten feet away. Sometimes one of the three would be
nearest, sometimes another, but none ever left the
side of the grey car until the next was ready to take
its place.</p>

<p>The result both pleased and puzzled French. It
pleased him because it proved him correct in assuming
the story of the gambling to be a fabrication.
After a brief good morning, lip-read by Carter, the
girl did not speak to Welland during the whole trip,
nor did money or letters pass between them. But
French was puzzled by what she did. For at least
a minute she leant forward and appeared to feel at
something at her feet.</p>

<p>He pondered over this for some time, but could
think of no explanation but the obvious one that
the girl was putting something into or taking
something out of a hidden receptacle. If so, he must
inspect the car and find it. Should this be his next
step?</p>

<p>He thought so except for one point. Would it
not be better to see first if he could get anything out
of the other three girls?</p>

<p>Eventually he decided that it would. If his
inquiries were reported to Welland it could scarcely
matter whether it was by one girl or four. If he,
French, knew as much as he evidently did know
about the movements of Molly, Welland would
recognize that he must know of the other girls
also.</p>

<p>Next morning therefore he made his three calls,
in every case unfortunately without result. All the
girls showed signs of anxiety, amounting almost to
terror, on learning his business. But all, after the
application of a varying amount of pressure, told
the story of the gambling. He was satisfied that
each was lying and that the story had been rehearsed
beforehand for use in just such an emergency.</p>

<p>There remained then the search of the car. To
arrange an opportunity was not an easy proposition.
For a time he considered means of getting it
to the Yard, such as the arrest of Welland “by
error,” followed by an apology and an immediate
release. But he thought that as long as any other
way remained, his superiors would not stand for such
a method. Besides, if by some remote chance the
girls had not reported his activities to Welland, it
would put the man on his guard.</p>

<p>At last he decided that there was nothing for it
but for him once again to play the burglar. He
must somehow get into the garage at night, when
he would have plenty of time to make an exhaustive
examination.</p>

<p>Though he did not see just how he was going to
manage it, he decided that the very next day he
would make the attempt.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>Chapter X. <br/> Mr. Cracksman French</h2>

<p>The first step which French took to meet his
new problem was to make a reconnaissance of the
enemy’s country. He went early next morning to
Tate’s Lane, so as to get the job over before Welland
should turn up. The gate of the coachbuilder’s
yard was open and he walked boldly in and had a
look round.</p>

<p>A closer inspection confirmed the impression of
a small, moribund business which the view from the
street had suggested. The establishment covered a
narrow frontage, but stretched a good way back.
In the foreground stood a number of horse carts and
lorries, awaiting the scrapheap, if one were to judge
by appearances. These with some spare parts filled
up all the open space to the high boundary wall on
the left, except for a narrow passage to the back
of the yard. Along the right ran a grimy brick
building from which came sounds of hammering.
The only structure with a well-to-do appearance was
a new shed of about twenty feet by ten, built as a
lean-to in the back lefthand corner. Numerous
pneumatic tire tracks leading to the large door in
the gable showed that this was Curtice Welland’s
garage.</p>

<p>Though the sounds from the shed indicated that
work was there in progress, no one was to be seen
in the yard. French therefore strolled close up to
the garage to see if he could find a way to break and
enter. But the more he saw the less easy this
appeared. The building was of solid brickwork with
a slated roof. The large door was fastened with
the most modern form of chubb lock, against which
French knew that his bent wires and skeleton keys
would have but little chance. In the side wall was a
small window with a fixed sash. The other two sides
were formed by the unbroken boundary walls of
the yard.</p>

<p>Thinking he had better not be seen poking about,
he turned back to the shed and looked in. Three
men were employed, one turning hubs at a small
lathe, the other two assembling lorry bodies. On
seeing French one of the latter came slowly forward.</p>

<p>“Morning,” said French. “You the boss?”</p>

<p>“ ’E’s out,” the man answered, adroitly
expectorating. “ ’Oo want’s ’im?”</p>

<p>“I do,” French explained. “Name of Simkins.
I want a garage for a car I’ve got and I was told
that you let them.”</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“But I thought that garage in the corner was
let to an outsider?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. But the boss ’e didn’t ’ave nothing
to say to the building. ’E only let the ground.”</p>

<p>“I follow you. Then it’s occupied, is it? I
couldn’t get it, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not likely, you couldn’t. The man wot keeps
’is car in that garage ’ad it specially built for ’im last
year.”</p>

<p>“Any chance of my getting a bit of ground to build
another?”</p>

<p>“You’d ’ave to see the boss abaht that,” the man
declared. “I couldn’t fix it for you.”</p>

<p>“I want one like that in the corner,” French
persisted. “Could I see into it?”</p>

<p>“Not without you got leave from Mr. Welland,
you couldn’t. ’E keeps the key. See ’ere, mister.
You call back ’ere abaht three o’clock an’ you’ll see
the boss. ’E’ll tell you all you wants to know.”</p>

<p>“That’s common sense.” French chatted pleasantly
and a couple of shillings changed ownership.
Then on his way to the gate he made a bid for the
second piece of information he required.</p>

<p>“I wonder you don’t get your stuff stolen at
night,” he said, after leading up to the subject by
remarks on the spare parts lying around. “But
then I suppose you have a watchman?”</p>

<p>“We don’t ’ave no watchman. It ain’t necessary.
It wouldn’t be so easy to steal anything as wot you’d
think, mister. This is all ’eavyish stuff, and if
anyone was to pass it out over the wall, ten chances to
one but a bobby’d catch ’em on.”</p>

<p>In a thoughtful mood French returned to the
Yard. By hook or by crook he would examine that
car, even if he had to commit a felony. He knew
that if he were found out he would get into trouble,
but he felt the case had dragged on so long that for
his own reputation’s sake he must get results
without further delay.</p>

<p>On reaching the Yard he sent for Sergeant
Ormsby. Ormsby had gone through his apprenticeship
as a carpenter before he joined the force, and
being skilful with his hands, he was in request where
delicate manual work was required.</p>

<p>“I want to do a burglary tonight, Ormsby,”
French began. “Are you on to give me a hand? I
can’t tell you to, but I’d be glad of your help, and
if there’s trouble I’ll stand the racket.”</p>

<p>Ormsby grinned. “Right-ho, Mr. French. It
won’t be the first time.”</p>

<p>“I want to break into a garage. There’s a heavy
door with a chubb lock that we can do nothing with.
But there’s a window that we might get the glass
out of. The frame is glazed with a single pane
of rough rolled, about eighteen inches by
twenty-four.”</p>

<p>“And you want me to take it out?”</p>

<p>“Right first shot. Can you do it, and put it back
so’s it won’t be noticed?”</p>

<p>Ormsby shook his head. He could try, but he
wouldn’t go nap on the result.</p>

<p>“Then better take a pane with you.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of the size?”</p>

<p>“No, but take it big and take a diamond as well.
You’ll want the usual things, and some reddish
brown paint and dust. We’ll try and get the lock
off from the inside and then perhaps you could cut
a key.”</p>

<p>Ormsby was dubious as to the possibilities, but
delighted at the prospect of adventure, and departed
jubilantly to get his paraphernalia together.</p>

<p>It was getting on towards two o’clock next morning
when the two men set out. Both were wearing
dark clothes, caps, and rubber shoes. Except for
Ormsby’s pane of glass, wrapped up neatly in dark
coloured paper, there was nothing to draw an
observer’s attention to them. In addition to the glass
Ormsby had a small kit of tools, while French
carried two electric torches and a large black
overcoat.</p>

<p>Tate’s Lane, when they reached it, was deserted
save for a single policeman patrolling slowly towards
its far end.</p>

<p>“When he goes round the corner we’ll have our
opportunity,” said French, who had looked up the
areas covered by all the adjacent beats.</p>

<p>They waited in York Street until the man
disappeared, then followed him down Tate’s Lane. Two
minutes later they were at the coachbuilder’s.</p>

<p>“Now for it,” said French, glancing quickly round.</p>

<p>No one was in sight. Opposite, the houses were
in darkness except for a single lighted window, which
showed a dull yellow square against the surrounding
gloom. Rather a nuisance, French thought. Someone
over there was awake and might chance to look
out.</p>

<p>“I’ll go first,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Ormsby laid his glass against the wall, and forming
a back, gave French a hoist up on to the wall.
A moment later French had dropped softly to the
ground within. Quickly the glass and tools were
handed over, and in ten seconds more Ormsby also
was inside.</p>

<p>They stood listening, but the silence was
reassuring, and they tiptoed to the garage and set to
work on the window. French directed the beam
from his torch and held up the coat to screen the
light, while Ormsby tackled the removal of the
glass.</p>

<p>The night was ideal for their purpose. There
was no moon, but the light of the stars showed up
faintly the larger objects, while allowing the men
to work unseen. It was calm and sounds carried
far. In the street they could hear the footsteps of
the returning policeman ring sharply.</p>

<p>Soon the putty was cut away and the sprigs
withdrawn. Then, affixing rubber suckers to the
corners, Ormsby pulled. This was the critical
operation, but he worked skilfully and gradually one
corner after another came away and he was able to
lift out the pane.</p>

<p>“Fine,” French whispered. “Now a hand in.”</p>

<p>A flash from the torch showed that there was a
small bench beneath the window. With difficulty
French squeezed through on to the bench and
dropped noiselessly to the floor. Immediately he
opened the door, Ormsby slipped in, and the door
was shut.</p>

<p>Their first care was to rig the coat over the
window lest the light should betray them. Then
while Ormsby started on his doorkey, French with
the other torch examined the car.</p>

<p>His search was extraordinarily thorough. From
tires to roof and from headlights to numberplate he
went over every detail. But absolutely without
result. The car was a perfectly normal 15/20
Mercury saloon, probably worth £450 when new. It
was upholstered in grey leatherette and the small
fittings were complete and excellent in quality.</p>

<p>With a helpless, baffled feeling, French stood
pondering. Were all his ideas of the affair erroneous?
Did these girls really use the car only to register bets
with the driver?</p>

<p>For a moment he thought it must be so. Then
the face of poor pretty Thurza Darke came up
before his imagination as he had seen it in the
Portsmouth police station. No. There was something
in their drives more deadly and sinister than
gambling. Crime, terrible and dastardly, lurked there.</p>

<p>Setting his jaw grimly, he turned back to the car.
There <em>must</em> be something.</p>

<p>He sat down once more on the back seat, and
stooping forward as the girls had done, marked
the area which his fingers could reach. On that
space he worked, examining joints, testing for secret
springs, measuring cubic capacities. And then
suddenly he found what he wanted.</p>

<p>Beneath the back seat was the petrol tank. This
he had already measured and dipped, and it had
seemed to fill the entire space. But now he found
that a thin steel plate, hinged along the floor, turned
up in front of the tank. It fitted so well that at first
he had taken it for the front of the tank itself. But
he had accidentally pressed a secret spring, and the
plate had moved forward. Attached to the inside
of the plate, and fitting into a recess in the tank,
was a small steel pocket, lined with velvet. The
recess was triangular in cross-section, which
explained the fact that he had been able to push
Ormsby’s steel rule right down to the bottom of
the tank, and even feel round its edges, without
discovering the trick.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A schematic diagram showing a cross       section of the petrol tank. The entire shape is square, but the       actual tank is a trapezoid, leaving a small triangular space at       the front, with a hinge on that side allowing access. Inside the       triangular space is a large container, or pocket." src="images/tank.jpg" id="img_images_tank.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>French breathed a sigh of relief. At last the
action of the girls was clear. On entering the car
they had stooped down, lowered the plate, put in or
taken out some object, raised the plate again and
dismounted. After arrival from his round, or before
starting, Welland had emptied or filled the pocket.</p>

<p>But beyond the admittedly crucial point that his
suspicions had been proved justified, French had
learned nothing. That the objects transmitted were
small was now certain, but this had been probable
from the first.</p>

<p>In vain he searched for some fragment in the
velvet lining of the pocket which might indicate the
nature of the transitory contents. In vain he longed
for the skill of Dr. Thorndyke, who might have been
able with his vacuum extractor to secure microscopic
dust from its fibres, which would have solved the
problem.</p>

<p>Satisfied that he had learnt all he could from the
car, he turned to the examination of the building
itself.</p>

<p>There was not much to examine. The four walls,
unbroken save for door and window, were finished
smoothly with cement. Under the window was the
bench, a plain structure offering no hiding place.
The roof was not ceiled, the rafters, slating laths,
and slates being visible. The floor was of concrete,
sloping slightly towards the central pit. A
four-inch drain level with the bottom of the pit led
away through the end wall opposite the door, and
above it, let into the garage floor, was a cast iron
inspection chamber cover. A four-inch metal pipe
rose up the wall and passed through the roof. All
was perfectly normal and in order.</p>

<p>French glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“Nearly finished, Ormsby?”</p>

<p>“Just about, Mr. French. See here.”</p>

<p>He turned his new key in the lock and the bolt
shot back.</p>

<p>“Good. We can get in now any time.” French
pointed to the pipe which ran up the wall. “What’s
that thing for?”</p>

<p>“Vent pipe,” Ormsby returned. “That’s all right.
Required to ventilate the drain.”</p>

<p>French nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m satisfied with everything here except the
drains. Best have this inspection chamber cover off
and see that all is O. K.”</p>

<p>Beneath the cover the drain from the pit ran
across the cement bottom in a channel, ending up in
a drop or well full of water, above which was a
round plug about four inches in diameter. Still
higher up an open four-inch pipe led to the base of
the vertical one.</p>

<p>“All perfectly O. K.,” Ormsby pronounced.
“Here is the drain from the pit leading into its
disconnecting trap, and here”——he pointed to the
plug—“is the inlet for clearing out the pipe if it
should get stopped. This,” indicating the high level
open pipe, “is the vent pipe. It turns up the wall
and has an outlet above the roof. All perfectly
correct.”</p>

<p>With a sigh French helped him to lift the inspection
chamber cover into place. On the whole he was
disappointed with his visit. He had hoped that it
would have given him the solution of the mystery,
but beyond proving that there really was a mystery,
he had learnt nothing.</p>

<p>“Get that glass in,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>Once again he held the torch and coat while
Ormsby worked. Quickly the window was glazed
and the fresh work painted with rapidly drying
paint, which in its turn was dusted over with various
coloured powders until it had practically resumed
its original appearance. Then watching their
chance, the two men climbed back into Tate’s Lane
and so to their respective homes.</p>

<p>The discovery of the secret pocket in the car
seemed to French to rule out one of his theories.
The scheme was not for the purpose of keeping
members of an organization in touch with
headquarters. Something material was being handed
over. What could it be?</p>

<p>The girls’ occupation suggested money, some
scheme for robbing the tills of their various
establishments. But then, so far as his information
went, they <em>weren’t</em> robbing their tills.</p>

<p>There were two ways, French saw, to settle the
matter. The first was to arrest two of the girls
on some trumped-up charge, one just before she was
picked up by the car, and the other immediately
after she was set down. One or other would necessarily
be carrying the stuff. The second way was to
shadow Welland more closely than ever and take
him in the act of receiving or parting with it.</p>

<p>Of the two, French preferred the second. To
take the girls to the Yard on suspicion would
precipitate events too rapidly. He would no doubt
find out what was being passed as well as getting
Welland, but Style and the girl Lestrange would
probably give him the slip. And he must get all
three, for all, he felt positive, were concerned in
the murders. No, he was not yet ready to take
action. He must first find out what was going on.</p>

<p>A more intense shadowing of Welland seemed
therefore to be indicated. French went over in his
mind what he had already learnt of the man’s
movements.</p>

<p>Observation had shown that on his journeys between
his house, his office, his garage, and the golf
links he had held no communication with any other
person. His entire time, therefore, was accounted
for except the periods spent in those four places.</p>

<p>French called in two of his men and instructed
them to get what help they required and watch the
office and the garage day and night, shadowing to
his home anyone other than Welland who might
enter either.</p>

<p>The house and links he decided he would tackle
himself, and he settled down to think out a scheme
for doing so.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch11">

<h2>Chapter XI. <br/> The Happy Paterfamilias</h2>

<p>Some fifteen minutes later he sent once more for
Sergeant Ormsby.</p>

<p>“You have a son, haven’t you, Ormsby?” he
asked. “A nipper of about ten?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir.”</p>

<p>“A smart lad, able to put through a bit of
play-acting?”</p>

<p>Ormsby smiled.</p>

<p>“If you had seen him doing Tom Mix in ‘Miss
Hook of Hollywood’ at a children’s show out our
way you wouldn’t need to ask.”</p>

<p>“The very thing. Could you spare him for an
hour or two to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Mr. French. He’s on holidays now
in any case.”</p>

<p>“Then how would this work?” French outlined
his plan and the other laughed.</p>

<p>“Suit the boy first class,” he observed with a
chuckle, “and suit me too for the matter of that.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then we’ll leave in time to be at Harrow
Station before the seven-seventeen in the
morning.”</p>

<p>Next day French, and an intelligent but somewhat
mischievous looking boy, alighted at Harrow
shortly before nine. They were dressed for their
parts. French was obviously a landed proprietor on
a visit to town, while Freddie Ormsby was a
convincing study of a preparatory school boy. Having
seen Welland leave by the 9.17, they strolled into
the town.</p>

<p>“Now, sonny, we’ve got to kill an hour or two.
What would you like? Coffee or an ice?”</p>

<p>Freddie’s predilection being for ices, they found a
shop and gave a bumper order. French sipped coffee
and smoked a lengthy pipe, and then they went
for a walk. It was not till nearly eleven that they
found themselves at the end of Acacia Avenue.</p>

<p>“Now, Fred, here we are. Do your best, like a
good chap.”</p>

<p>They strolled down the road, evidently strangers
to the place, and as evidently father and son. At
all vacant lots they stopped, clearly discussing a
possible dwelling. Next door to No. 39 was such a
lot, and at this they halted in its turn.</p>

<p>“That bow window on the ground floor,” French
said in low tones, as he demonstrated with gestures
how the ground might be terraced.</p>

<p>On his previous visit he had noted the exterior of
the house, and by plotting the various elevations, he
had deduced its probable plan. From this he was
satisfied that the window in question belonged to
Welland’s sitting room. No other had a large
enough expanse of blank wall beside it for the
necessary size of the room.</p>

<p>Freddie Ormsby acted with promptitude.</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy, see!” he cried in shrill tones. “Look
where the cat is!” and before his scandalized parent
could intervene, he had picked up a stone and sent
it whizzing with unerring aim through the largest
pane.</p>

<p>“Played, sir! Fine shot!” French whispered, then
in loud tones: “Well, upon my soul, you little rascal!
Look what you’ve done. What do you mean, sir,
by such conduct?”</p>

<p>The door of No. 39 was opened by an elderly
woman with an indignant countenance as an angry
but apologetic gentleman and a scared, woebegone
boy approached up its tiny drive.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, madam,” said French, taking off his
hat politely, “that an accident has occurred for which
I am responsible. My son has so far forgotten
himself as to throw a stone which unfortunately
has broken your window. He has been warned
about stone throwing again and again, and I’ll see
that this time it will be a lesson to him. I can only
offer you, madam, my apologies, and go at once for
a glazier to make good the damage.”</p>

<p>The good lady, who had evidently been prepared
to breathe threatenings and slaughter, on finding
the wind thus taken out of her sails, became
somewhat mollified.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if that’s the way you put it, it will
be all right,” she admitted, “though it did give
me a start and no mistake, the stone coming through.
But there,” she went on magnanimously, glancing
at the frightened culprit, “you don’t need to say
too much to ’im. Boys will be boys, that’s what I
say. Boys will be boys.”</p>

<p>“It’s exceedingly kind of you to look at it like
that,” French declared. “As I said, I can assure you
it will be a lesson to him he will not soon forget.
I hope nothing has been damaged inside the room?”</p>

<p>“Well, I ’aven’t looked yet. Better come in and
see for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And I think it will save time if I
get a sample of the glass and measure the window.”</p>

<p>Having adjured “Cecil” to wait for him and not
to get into any more mischief while his back was
turned, French followed the housekeeper. The
room, as he had imagined, was Welland’s sitting
room. It was comfortably though not luxuriously
furnished. In the window was a deep saddle-bag
armchair with beside it a table bearing some papers.
Against one wall was a roll-top desk, with the cover
down. A tantalus and a cigar cabinet stood on a
second table. Many shelves of books hung on the
wall.</p>

<p>“The desk,” thought French, as he expressed his
relief that no further damage had been done and
took his measurements. Two minutes later he
withdrew in an atmosphere of politeness and regrets.</p>

<p>“You did that well, old man,” he congratulated
his now grinning companion, when at last they were
clear of Acacia Avenue. “You shall have five bob
and the best lunch I can get you.”</p>

<p>At the station they met Ormsby, clad in a glazier’s
well-worn overalls and with smudges of paint on
his cap.</p>

<p>“He did it fine,” French greeted him, “you’ll be
having the lad in the films yet. There’s the size of
the pane and there’s what it was glazed with. Have
you got what’ll do it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ormsby, “but there’s a glazier’s down
the street. I’ll get it there. It was the room you
wanted all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s a desk in it that you’ll have to
go through. How’ll you do if the old woman sticks
in the room?”</p>

<p>Ormsby smiled. “Trust me for that, Mr. French.
You may not have known it, but it sometimes takes
a terrible lot of hot water to glaze a pane. I’ll
keep her boiling up fresh kettles.”</p>

<p>Three hours later Ormsby knocked at the door
of French’s room at the Yard.</p>

<p>“There’s absolutely nothing there, Mr. French,”
he began, as he took the seat to which the other
pointed. “I had a bit of luck, and I’ve been through
practically the whole house and there’s not a thing
that you could get hold of. In the first place that
old woman’s a bit deaf and that helped me.”</p>

<p>“I noticed it,” said French.</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, I went to the door and said I was
the man come to glaze the pane and she had me in
at once and I got to work. She hung about for a
minute or two, but I didn’t speak, and when she
saw me getting at it, she said she would be next
door in the kitchen if I wanted anything and went
out.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for you.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it, sir? But better than that, she was
washing clothes and as long as I could hear the suds
going I knew I was safe. I made some mess round
the window to show I was working and then I went
for the desk. It was an easy lock and I had it
open in twenty seconds. I went through everything
and there’s not a paper nor any other thing that
shouldn’t be there. All absolutely O. K.”</p>

<p>“Pity,” French interjected.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it? Then I made some more mess and had
a look round the room and a quick run through the
books. Then the old lady came in to see how I
was getting on.”</p>

<p>He paused, and French nodded his appreciation
of the situation.</p>

<p>“She seemed satisfied with the amount of the mess
and went back to the kitchen without speaking and I
heard the washing start again. I thought I might
take a bit of risk, so I slipped upstairs and found
the man’s bedroom. I was afraid to stay too long,
but I was long enough to make sure there was nothing
there either. So then I came down and finished
up the pane and painted the putty and came away.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s that, Ormsby.”</p>

<p>“Sorry I couldn’t get more, Mr. French.”</p>

<p>“We may do our best to cook up evidence,”
French said, with the twinkle in his eye showing
even more clearly than usual, “but I draw the line
at inventing it if it’s not there.”</p>

<p>Here was another disappointment. French had
been building more even than he knew on Ormsby’s
search of the house, and when this also had drawn
blank his chagrin was correspondingly great. The
affair was certainly exasperating. It was a long time
since he had felt so completely puzzled.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, however, but to carry
on with the plan he had made, and five o’clock that
afternoon saw him at the club-house of Welland’s
golf course, inquiring for the secretary.</p>

<p>“This is a confidential matter, Mr. Allan,” he
began when he was seated in that gentleman’s office,
“and I do not know that I can claim your help in it.
I can however ask for it, and that I am going to
do.”</p>

<p>The secretary murmured politely.</p>

<p>“It concerns a member of your club,” went on
French, “Mr. Curtice Welland. Now I may say
in confidence that we have reason to suspect that
Mr. Welland may not be all that he appears to be.
In fact we think,” French dropped his voice, “that
he is one of a trio involved in no less a crime than
murder.”</p>

<p>The secretary stared.</p>

<p>“Curtice Welland?” he repeated incredulously.
“Surely not, Inspector. Curtice Welland involved
in a murder! You can’t ask me to believe that.”
He shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>“Then you know him well?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, I don’t. I really scarcely
know him at all. But he has always seemed so quiet
and inoffensive; the last type of man that one would
associate with such a crime.”</p>

<p>“So was Dr. Crippen, and so was many another
murderer, Mr. Allan,” French said seriously. “Manner
and appearance are unfortunately no guide, as
you would know if you had my experience. But I
make no accusation against the man. It may be
that the Yard is mistaken in its view. And that’s
what I have been sent here to find out. I am
investigating Mr. Welland’s life and character. And it is
in that capacity I have come to ask your help.”</p>

<p>Allan hesitated, frowning.</p>

<p>“Mr. Welland is a member of the club,” he said
at last. “He is in a sense my employer. I don’t
know that I feel at liberty to discuss him even if I
knew anything against him, which thank heaven I
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said French with a smile, “if you
don’t know anything that settles the matter, doesn’t
it?” Then he came to his real objective. “But
there is a bit of quite harmless information that
perhaps you could give me. It is a list of Mr.
Welland’s particular friends among the members or of
anyone with whom he plays regularly. This will
not be giving anything away on your part, because
you must see that I could find it out for myself by
simple observation.”</p>

<p>Allan replied with evident relief. He would
be glad to help the Inspector, but there were no
such persons. Mr. Welland had catholic tastes. He
played with anyone who was available, not with any
one in particular.</p>

<p>French was more than ever worried as he
returned to the Yard. Almost in despair he
redoubled his efforts. He put a number of men on to
watch Welland’s house, others he had shadow him
while golfing and at other free times, but all
without avail. As the days passed and he found that
no one visited the garage or the office, and that
Welland came into no regular touch with any human
being other than the four girls, he became almost ill
from anxiety. Gone was his usual cheery optimism,
his suavity, his pleasant words for his
subordinates. “Soapy Joe” was soapy no longer.</p>

<p>And then quite suddenly, as he lay one night
racking his brains over the problem, an explanation
of the whole business shot into his mind.
Tremulously he considered the idea, and the more he
thought over it the more certain he grew that he was
right.</p>

<p>Material objects were being carried in the secret
pocket of the car. Material objects were being put
in by Welland and taken out by the girls, and cash
was being put in by the girls and taken out by
Welland. The affair was a commercial proposition of a
highly lucrative, but highly immoral and illegal type.
These people were selling prohibited drugs!</p>

<p>And a good scheme it certainly was! Welland
in some way as yet unknown was getting the “snow”
or other stuff in bulk and making it up into small
packages. Every morning he would start out with
four bundles of such packages in the pocket of his
car. Every day each girl would remove a bundle
and replace it with a roll of notes. Every night,
on some preconcerted signal from her customer, she
would pass out with the metal disc of entrance to
the cinema a package of the stuff, pocketing the
notes given in exchange. The illicit sale of drugs
had increased by leaps and bounds, and of all the
methods of which French had yet heard, this was
certainly the best.</p>

<p>Here was ample motive for murder! Let the
gang get wind of communication between any of
their victims and Scotland Yard and the victim’s
fate was sealed. Both the gains of success and the
penalties of failure were too great to permit of any
risks being run.</p>

<p>In a few moments French’s whole outlook on life
had changed. Gone was his weariness, his lassitude,
his depression. Once more he was the optimist,
about to add one more laurel to the many he had
achieved in his career.</p>

<p>For this case would make a sensation. If there
was one thing more than another which the authorities
were keen on suppressing, it was this drug traffic.
If he pulled off a big coup in this line it could
not fail to affect his prospects.</p>

<p>And then came the usual reaction. It was not
all so clear as he had imagined. How and from
whom was Welland getting the stuff? How and to
whom was he passing on the money? French saw
that he had a good way to go before his case should
be complete.</p>

<p>As he thought of this side of the affair he swore
from vexation. Why, every investigation that he
had made had tended to show that the man was
neither obtaining drugs in bulk nor disposing of
large sums of money! Curse it all, he thought!
Was there ever such a tangle?</p>

<p>Almost in despair he had just decided that he
would have to fall back on his alternative scheme and
arrest and search two of the girls, when a further
possibility occurred to him. Could he not keep so
close a watch on the girls while in their box offices
that he could not fail to see small packages being
passed out.</p>

<p>To think of the idea was to act on it. Early
next morning French was once again closeted with
the manager of the Panopticon, in confidence putting
forward his suspicions and begging the other’s
help towards testing them.</p>

<p>As a result of their deliberations, three men in
the garb of electrical fitters arrived an hour later at
the Cinema. The boss of the little gang was named
Ormsby, and his helpers were Carter and Harvey.
It seemed that an electric main in the corner of the
entrance hall had given indications of fusing and
immediate repairs had become necessary.</p>

<p>The defect, it appeared, was hidden in the
wooden panelling alongside the box office presided
over by Molly Moran, and the first job of the
fitters was naturally to protect their work from
passers-by. When therefore the staff came on duty
for the afternoon session they found that a neat
canvas structure had been erected beside the box
office. Behind this the men worked, and from this
at five o’clock they went home.</p>

<p>All but one. From twelve-thirty that morning
till eleven-thirty that night French sat behind the
screen, his eyes glued to a hole in the canvas. From
this he could see every movement of Molly’s hands
on the little desk some five feet away.</p>

<p>His view of course was limited. His peep hole
was but slightly in front of the office and the side
wall of the opening cut off all movement on the
back of the little counter. But he could not have
placed his observation point further forward, as his
sight would then have been impeded by the backs
of the purchasers. But over a small area he had a
perfect view, and he did not believe that anything
could be slipped across unobserved by him.</p>

<p>The watch was tedious, but not so tedious as if
he had had to be on the strain all the time. He
knew that no attempt such as he expected could be
made during periods of rush booking: it would be
too dangerous. It was therefore only the booking
of isolated persons that he had to watch. And there
were other alleviations. The noise outside was so
great that he was able to change his position
without fear of discovery. Moreover he had taken in a
goodly supply of food, which he consumed at frequent
intervals. But still he thought the time would
never come to an end. Stiff and sore and with a
splitting headache he waited, until at last after the
performance, when all but the manager had left, he
crept out and thankfully stretched his cramped limbs.</p>

<p>His physical discomfort was however as nothing
to his mental perturbation. For he had seen nothing!
Moreover, so good had been his outlook, that
he was satisfied that there had been nothing to see.
Nothing was being passed out with the entrance
checks. Of that he could swear.</p>

<p>His drug theory was therefore false. Whatever
Welland was doing, it was not peddling opium.
Something else was being transferred through the
medium of the secret panel in the car.</p>

<p>French could have wept when he found himself
forced to this conclusion. Never in his life had he
been up against anything which had puzzled him
more. He would give a month’s pay, he thought
savagely, to get the thing cleared up.</p>

<p>That evening he had recourse once more to his
household oracle. Again he put his difficulties
before Mrs. French, and again light seemed to come
from doing so. Not that this time she made any
suggestions. Rather it was that his own mind clarified
and he saw that there was only one thing left
for him to do.</p>

<p>The arrest of the girls would be too dangerous.
He must therefore get Molly Moran’s confidence.
By hook or by crook he must force her to tell her
true story. And if he couldn’t frighten or cajole
her into keeping his interference secret from
Welland, why then he must just take the consequences.
He determined he would see her again, first thing
next day.</p>

<h2>Chapter XII. <br/> The Car’s Freight</h2>

<p>At nine o’clock next morning French rang up
the number he had noted on the Nelson Street
boarding house telephone, and asked for Miss Molly
Moran.</p>

<p>“It’s in connection with our previous conversation,
Miss Moran,” he explained. “There is a fresh
development which I want to discuss with you. Will
you meet me in half an hour at the same place as
before?”</p>

<p>Though she agreed, French could sense the
unwillingness in her tones. “Very good of you,” he
declared. “I’ll not keep you long.”</p>

<p>He greeted her pleasantly when she appeared, led
the way to a deserted seat in the Charing Cross
Gardens, supplied her with a cigarette, and for a
few moments chatted of everyday matters. Then
when she seemed more at her ease he turned to
business.</p>

<p>“What I want to see you about is this, Miss
Moran,” he said more gravely. “Since our last
interview I have learnt that this matter of Mr.
Welland is even more serious than I thought. I want
to tell you what I know and to ask your further
help. And first, are you quite satisfied that I really
am from Scotland Yard? Would you like to go
with me to the Yard where I am known?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mr. French,” she answered hastily,
“that’s not necessary at all. I am perfectly
satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Now I told you before that I believed
you were in personal danger from your association
with this man. I want to tell you why I
think so.”</p>

<p>She did not reply, but sat with a bored expression,
evidently trying to conceal her interest.</p>

<p>“Nearly three months ago,” went on French, “a
young lady named Thurza Darke was sent to the
Yard by a solicitor. This man had found out that
she had got into the clutches of a gang of crooks,
and he sent her to us for protection. Now, Miss
Moran, this young lady was employed in the box
office of the Milan Cinema in Oxford Street. That
is the first point.</p>

<p>“She said that on her way to business she had
met a young lady in the train, a Miss Gwen
Lestrange. She was a wealthy young lady, or seemed
to be, and they got talking about her money. As
Miss Lestrange said she was only a barmaid in a
theatre, Miss Darke asked where it came from.
With some appearance of hesitation she was told
it was from gambling at second hand on the Monte
Carlo tables. After further conversation Miss
Lestrange suggested that Miss Darke should have a
fling in the same way, and agreed to introduce her
to the man with whom she herself dealt. He was
then called Westinghouse. They met here in this
garden, and Westinghouse arranged the gambling.”</p>

<p>There was no question now of Miss Moran’s
attention. She was watching French with tense
interest, in fact with an expression almost of horror.</p>

<p>He glanced at her with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Is there any need for me to go on, Miss Moran?”
he said gently. “Can you not imagine the rest?
How Miss Darke won fair sums at first and thought
she was going to make her fortune. Then how
she began to lose; how at last she got into debt
to Westinghouse; how he became threatening and
swore he would report her to the cinema authorities;
how he threatened prosecution, imprisonment, until
the poor girl was almost beside herself with terror.
You can picture it, can you not, Miss Moran?”</p>

<p>That she could picture it in vivid detail was
evident. Her eyes were dilating and her face had
paled.</p>

<p>“The remainder I’m sure you can imagine also,”
went on French. “How at this crisis Miss
Lestrange turned up unexpectedly; how she was
sympathetically concerned about Miss Darke’s
woebegone appearance, and how she recommended
recourse to her cousin, who, she said, had helped her
out of a similar difficulty. Then how this man
played on Miss Darke’s fears in order to entrap
her in his evil schemes. Ah, I see I needn’t go into
it further. You evidently know as much as I do
about it.”</p>

<p>In truth the girl’s appearance left no doubt on
the point. French, pausing for a moment,
continued:</p>

<p>“Now I must tell you something that had happened
before. A very great friend of Miss Darke’s,
a young lady also employed in the box office of a
cinema, had recently died. She was a jolly, gay
young thing, but for several weeks she had appeared
to be in trouble. Then one day she disappeared
and later her body was found in a pool in a quarry.
There was a verdict of suicide, but Miss Darke
never believed she had committed suicide. She said
she was not that kind of girl, and she was convinced
that she had been murdered.</p>

<p>“Now Miss Darke had tried to get out of her
friend the cause of her trouble, but beyond the fact
that it was due to some man who had got her into
his power, the girl would not say. But she had
described the man, and what had terrified Miss Darke
was that the man to whom Miss Lestrange had sent
her exactly answered the description.</p>

<p>“This was his description: middling tall, thinnish,
fair haired, rather terrifying eyes, and”—French
paused for a moment, then added—“a purple scar
shaped like a sickle on the inside of his left wrist.”</p>

<p>Miss Moran gave a little gasping cry. She had
gone dead white and swayed as if faint.</p>

<p>“Steady on, Miss Moran,” French said sharply,
but in low tones. “You don’t want to attract
attention. You’re all right and perfectly safe. Pull
yourself together.”</p>

<p>With an evident effort the girl did so. She did
not belie the evidence of her firm little chin. Again
French told himself she was a young woman of
character.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be alarmed,” he went on. “I’m
here to help you out of your difficulties. We’ll
discuss that in a moment. Meanwhile I must finish
my story.</p>

<p>“As I say, Miss Darke recognized the man, and
very wisely she temporized. If he would give her
a couple of days to think it over she would come
to a decision. He agreed. By friends about whom
I needn’t explain she was persuaded to report the
circumstances at the Yard. Miss Moran,” French’s
voice became very grave, “she was evidently watched.
That night she disappeared, and two days later her
body was found in the sea near Portsmouth. In this
case there was no question of suicide. The poor
girl had been murdered before being thrown into
the sea.”</p>

<p>Once again his listener’s pallor grew deathlike,
and once again with an evident effort she pulled
herself together.</p>

<p>“I have one other thing to tell you. Inquiries
revealed the fact that some five months before Miss
Darke’s friend’s murder another young lady was
found drowned under suspicious circumstances. She
also was in the box office of a cinema. Absolute
proof was not obtainable, but there is no reasonable
doubt that she also was murdered by the same
gang.”</p>

<p>French paused, carefully lit a cigarette, glanced
keenly around and resumed.</p>

<p>“From all this, Miss Moran, you will see that
when I said I thought you might be in personal
danger I was basing my opinion on something very
real. I do not wish to frighten you unduly, but
you must see that unless some steps are taken it may
be your turn next. Now the question is, are you
going to be wise and confide in me?”</p>

<p>She did not answer and French also smoked in
silence to let the question sink into her mind.
Presently he went on: “There is also another side of
the affair which you must not overlook and about
which it is only fair that I should warn you. We
now know so much about what is going on that it is
only a question of time before we learn it all. If
you are then found to be doing something illegal
you will undoubtedly be charged with conspiracy
in the crime. If, on the other hand, you do all
you can to help the authorities, I will do all I can
to help you. Even if the matter should be too
serious for me to keep you out of court, your having
turned King’s evidence would get you off.”</p>

<p>It was evident that this view had not occurred to
the young lady. She looked even more frightened
and unhappy, though still she did not speak.</p>

<p>French grew impatient.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said in sharper tones, “I warn
you again that your own safety requires that you
should tell what you know, but if you won’t take
my warning I can’t help it. I am of opinion that
here and now you are carrying with you the object
or objects which you will shortly place in the secret
panel of Mr. Welland’s car. I shall have to take
you into custody on a charge of conspiracy and have
you searched so as to find out what that article is.”</p>

<p>His conscience pricked him slightly as he spoke.
Was this strictly in accordance with the rules for
the interrogation of a possible witness? Then he
thought he was justified. This girl would not
incriminate herself. He could swear she was innocent.
And anything was good enough for the murderers
of Thurza Darke.</p>

<p>The girl gave a little cry.</p>

<p>“Take me into custody!” she whispered hoarsely.
“Surely you wouldn’t do a thing like that?”</p>

<p>“I certainly would. I am going to find out about
this business at whatever cost. Come now,” he went
on more coaxingly, “be wise and come in on the
side that must win. As you are, you are running a
terrible risk.”</p>

<p>Though he spoke gravely, with secret delight he
noticed signs of breaking down. Miss Moran shivered
and slow, long sobs shook her frame. He remained
silent and then at last he heard what he had
been hoping for.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried piteously, “but this is terrible
altogether! I never thought anything like this
would happen to me. I didn’t mean any harm and
now look at the trouble I’m in. You’ll make it as
easy as you can for me if I tell you?”</p>

<p>“I have already promised, Miss Moran. Not only
that, but you’ll feel a weight off your mind. You
can’t have been happy with this going on.”</p>

<p>“Happy! I’ve been miserable. God only knows
how miserable I’ve been. And if I have been making
money, sure I’ve paid for it by the terror I’ve been
in. I’ll tell you everything.”</p>

<p>She was now sobbing freely and French once more
urged her to control herself lest attention should
be drawn to her. Presently, in rather tremulous
tones she began.</p>

<p>“The whole thing happened just as you say, Mr.
French. Every day I go to business by the tube and
it was there I met the girl you spoke of. We got
to be the best of friends, but all the time I was
wondering where she got her money. One day I
asked her, and then she told me about the gambling
at Monte Carlo. She said if I would like a go at it
she would arrange it for me, all just as you said.
She said the bookmaker would meet us here. He
did and he was the very man you described. Och,
but he was the terrible man, Mr. French! There
was something about his eyes that would give you the
cold shivers. He was the man you mentioned
anyway, for I saw the scar on his wrist.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said French with satisfaction. “Did he
tell you his name?”</p>

<p>“He did. It was Style.”</p>

<p>“Good! That’s the man. And did you stake?”</p>

<p>“I did, and I won first and then I lost. At that
time Gwen Lestrange had got a job out of London
and had gone away, but I met her by chance and
she asked me how I was getting on. When I told
her she said she thought her cousin could help me
and she introduced me to him. That was Mr.
Welland.”</p>

<p>French was highly pleased. At last he was
making progress. Welland and Style had been
concerned in the death of Thurza Darke, and already
he had Welland under observation. A little more
of that observation would undoubtedly lead him to
Style.</p>

<p>He wondered why the two scoundrels had changed
their respective roles. In Thurza Darke’s case
Welland (or Westinghouse) had been the bookmaker
and Style the cousin. In Molly Moran’s,
Style was the bookmaker and Welland the cousin.
Probably, thought French, to divide equally both the
risks and the responsibilities. With some surprise
also he noted that while Welland had taken the
precaution to change his name, Style had not
troubled to do so. No doubt for this also there was a
reason.</p>

<p>“Well, and what did Mr. Welland say to you?”</p>

<p>The girl was evidently trying hard for self-control.
She had succeeded in choking down her sobs,
but her voice was still tremulous as she went on.</p>

<p>“He was as pleasant and friendly as you’d wish.
He said he was sorry about my difficulties and that
he could offer me a job which would not only get me
out of them, but would pay me well besides. And it
wouldn’t interfere with my work at the cinema, for
all he wanted could be done between times when I
wasn’t selling tickets. He said it was the fine easy
job, but it had one thing about it that I mightn’t
like, and then he looked at me and asked me was I
very strait-laced in my ideas.</p>

<p>“Well, as a matter of fact, Mr. French, I’m not
strait-laced at all. So I did not, and he said that
that was fortunate, as it was the only drawback the
job had. There were some strait-laced people who
might object to it, but not ordinary men and women
of the world. Anyway it was safe enough and
absolutely moral and no one would ever know anything
about it. Besides I needn’t go on with it unless I
wanted to.</p>

<p>“I asked him what the job was and he said that
was going too fast, he would have to have my word
first to carry it out for at least a week. After that
I could go on or not as I liked. He said that if I
promised he would begin by giving me enough to
square Mr. Style. Then he said that maybe I would
like a day or two to think it over and that I could
come back and see him again.”</p>

<p>“A plausible ruffian,” French commented, now
speaking in his pleasantest tones. “I’m sure that’s
just what he said to your predecessors. And what
did you answer?”</p>

<p>The girl hung her head.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. French, I’m not pretending I didn’t
do wrong, but just think of my position. I had only
my job to live by and I was going to lose it in a
way that would have prevented me getting another.
Then there was this job offered me, maybe not just
all right, but safe anyway. It was a choice of two
evils; of possible ruin if I accepted or of certain
ruin if I didn’t. I took the chance.”</p>

<p>“Of course you did. I can see the fix you were in
and I’m not blaming you.”</p>

<p>“Well, to make a long story short, I told Mr.
Welland I would take his job. He smiled and shook
hands and congratulated me. He said I’d never be
sorry for what I was doing and then he handed me
ten pounds, saying that here was part of the money
I owed Mr. Style and that if I paid this much Mr.
Style would certainly give me time to meet the rest.
He made me sign an I.O.U. for it, and he said I
had better go and pay Mr. Style at once.</p>

<p>“Next time Mr. Style came to the Gardens I
was waiting for him. He was very threatening
at first, but when I showed him the ten pounds it
changed his manner. He said he was glad I wasn’t
going to make trouble and that he would take that
on account and give me three more weeks to find
the other fifteen. He was so pleasant that in spite
of the job I felt easier in my mind than I had for
many a day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder,” French commented. “I think
you did what any other girl would have done in your
position, though I suppose I should not say so.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Welland had given me an appointment for
two hours later and I met him in Hyde Park. He
told me that one of his friends was in the Mint and
had unexpectedly found a crate full of old half
crowns in a disused cellar. He supposed they had
been called in for renewal and been forgotten. The
friend did not see why they should lie there, and he
began taking some home every evening. But he was
afraid to get rid of them, for some of them bore
the Mint rejection mark. He had consulted Mr.
Welland as to how this might be done, and that
was where I came in. My job would be to pass out
the half crowns to the public. Every morning Mr.
Welland would give me so many and I was to pay
them out in change at the pay-box. For every half
crown I paid out I was to put another aside from
the till for Mr. Welland, and when I met him next
day I was to hand these over to him, less a
percentage.”</p>

<p>“And did you believe his story?”</p>

<p>The girl hung her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she admitted in a low voice, “but as he put
it it didn’t seem so bad. He said the whole business,
so far as I was concerned, was perfectly honest.
The half crowns were good and worth their full
value. My cash at the cinema could be examined
at any moment and would be found O. K. The only
thing the most strait-laced could object to was his
friend’s taking these old coins from the Mint in the
first instance. But I had nothing to do with that.”</p>

<p>“And once again, did you believe that?”</p>

<p>“No,” and the girl’s voice was very mournful,
“and I said I didn’t to Mr. Welland. But it was no
good. He said that if I felt the slightest qualms
about the matter, not to go on with it on any
account at all. He would be the last person to press
me to do what I thought was wrong. If I didn’t
like it I could drop it. I had only to hand him back
his ten pounds and I would be clear of it.”</p>

<p>“He had you there.”</p>

<p>“He had me so that I couldn’t wriggle. I begged
him to let me go, but he said ten pounds were ten
pounds, and that he couldn’t afford to lose all that
money and get nothing against it. Then I said I
would tell the police the whole thing. That annoyed
him. He advised me just to try it. He asked me
did I imagine my story would be believed? There
was I without a scrap of proof, but he had my I.O.U.
He said if I went to the police it would be me that
would go to prison for perjury and defamation of
character.”</p>

<p>“So you agreed to pass the money?”</p>

<p>“What else could I do, Mr. French? I owed
fifteen pounds to one of these men and ten to the
other, and both said they would get me the sack if
I didn’t pay. And I hadn’t any money and they
wouldn’t give me time.”</p>

<p>Here, thought French in high delight, was something
tangible at last! A gleam of light was beginning
to illumine these mysterious happenings.
With a keener interest he went on.</p>

<p>“You said less a percentage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ten per cent. One half crown in every
ten they let me keep.”</p>

<p>“And how many do you change per day?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course it varies, but it would be a bad
day that I wouldn’t change a hundred. The most
I ever did was a hundred and forty-five.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, you’ve not been doing so badly!
What have you been making? Eight or ten pounds
a week?”</p>

<p>“About that. As I say, it varies, but I generally
get at least eight.”</p>

<p>French was astonished. No wonder this gang
secured loyal helpers! With her ordinary wages
this girl must be in receipt of something not far
short of six hundred a year. He had certainly frightened
her to some purpose if she was willing to risk
the loss of such an income.</p>

<p>“H’m,” he said with grim pleasantry. “It really
looks like a case of your money or your life. But
I don’t want to keep you here too long. From
what you tell me it would be better that we shouldn’t
be seen together. Just explain how you carry the
half crowns to and from the cinema.”</p>

<p>“In my vanity bag.” She was about to open it,
but French checked her.</p>

<p>“Don’t show me,” he said. “Explain.”</p>

<p>“There are three compartments in this bag. The
centre one is like an ordinary bag, and I keep my
own things in it, handkerchief and so on. The two
side ones shut with a spring, and unless you
examined the bag very carefully, you wouldn’t know
they were there. One of these spring compartments
is coloured red inside and the other green. In the
red one are the half crowns from Mr. Welland. As
I take them out I put other half crowns from the
till into the green one. Sometimes I don’t get all
Mr. Welland’s changed, and the colours keep them
separate.”</p>

<p>“Why do you only put in half crowns? Wouldn’t
two shillings and a sixpence from the till do as
well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Mr. Welland told me to put in
half crowns only.”</p>

<p>Evidently to keep the percentage of coins of various
values normal in the till, French imagined. If
so, it showed an attention to detail which deserved
success. He thought rapidly whether he had got
all the information he could expect from this
particular source, and decided that he had.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Moran,” he said earnestly, “you
must be careful of yourself for a few days. Go
straight home after your show and keep to
populous streets. Even in the daytime avoid lonely
places. Don’t accept a message from anyone you
don’t know. Most important of all, don’t get into
any kind of a private car or taxi. This is not to
frighten you, but to keep you safe. A few days
and we’ll have the gang and then you will be all
right. One other thing: if you notice anything in
the least degree suspicious, ring me up—Victoria
7000. You will find plenty of help if you’re in
trouble. You understand all that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Mr. French. And I can’t say how
glad I am to have told you. I was making money
all right, but no money would be worth the terror
I’ve endured. Mr. Welland was always telling me
that if the thing leaked out I was done for. It
would be the sack for certain and maybe prison as
well. I’ve been perfectly wretched and the relief
is just beyond words.”</p>

<p>French nodded gravely as the girl finished
speaking. Another explanation of the affair had just
flashed into his mind, an explanation so obvious that
he could not understand why he had not instantly
thought of it. These coins had never seen the Mint!
They were forgeries. He would have staked long
odds that he was on a gang of counterfeit coiners.</p>

<p>If so he must get hold of some samples without
delay.</p>

<p>“What have you got in your bag now?” he asked.
“Coins from Mr. Welland or from the till?”</p>

<p>“From the till. These are the coins I changed
yesterday. I’ll find Mr. Welland’s parcel in the car
in an hour’s time.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I should have known that. Now,
I’ll see you again at the Panopticon. You’ll be sent
for by the manager. Take your bag with you. Do
you see?”</p>

<p>“Very good, Mr. French. I’ll remember all you
have told me.”</p>

<p>“Well, my last word to you is three don’ts: don’t
be frightened, don’t let Mr. Welland suspect our
meeting, and don’t do anything rash,” and wishing
her a pleasant good afternoon, he strolled out of the
gardens.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch13">

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br/> The Transport of Supplies</h2>

<p>Inspector French continued his stroll along the
Embankment until he reached the Yard. There,
after an interview with his chief, he got a cheque for
ten pounds, and going to the nearest bank, asked for
the money to be paid in half crowns. With his
pockets weighted down with the silver he went on to
the Panopticon and asked for the manager. As a
result of his conversation he was shown into a
waiting room, where presently he was joined by Molly
Moran.</p>

<p>“You here already, Mr. French?” she greeted
him.</p>

<p>“Yes. I want to get hold of some of those coins.
Here is ten pounds’ worth of half crowns. Just
count me out eighty of Mr. Welland’s.”</p>

<p>“But there’s nothing remarkable about them at
all. They’re just ordinary half crowns. I’ve shown
them to a friend of mine in a bank, and he said so
too.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said French, “so a bank clerk has seen
them, has he? But were you not afraid to tell him
about them?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell him at all. What I thought was
that maybe they weren’t good, that maybe Mr.
Welland’s friends was making them—counterfeit
coining, don’t you call it? So I showed my friend four
and said they’d been refused on the grounds that
they weren’t good. He said they were perfectly
all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” French repeated more dubiously. “Well,
I’ll have the eighty all the same. You might let
me see that bag now that we can’t be overlooked.”</p>

<p>It was just what Miss Moran had described, a
plain but large vanity bag with a central compartment
of normal appearance, and two side ones, each
capable of carrying some hundred and fifty half
crowns and fitted with an inside skin or bag which
could be lifted out with the coins. When these side
compartments were closed by their spring latches
they were invisible to casual inspection, though if
the bag were handled their existence became
obvious. French was not surprised therefore to learn
that Welland had given the strictest instructions that
the bag was to be carried looped on the girl’s arm
and never taken off except when she was actually
working in the pay-box.</p>

<p>But his interest in the bag was but slight
compared with that he felt in the coins which Miss
Moran had received from Welland. There were
130 and he tumbled them out on a table and began to
turn them over.</p>

<p>His first glance surprised him and increased that
feeling of depression which the girl’s story of the
bank clerk had aroused. That they were not new
was undoubted; all had clearly been in circulation.
Moreover the dates varied, and roughly speaking,
the wear on any individual coin corresponded with
its age.</p>

<p>Welland’s story was unlikely enough at the best,
but here already was proof of its falsity. These
coins had not been recalled from circulation because
of age or wear. They were still perfectly good.</p>

<p>French swore internally as he realized the conclusion
to which he was being forced. If these coins
were of different dates and had been in circulation
they were not forgeries. Dies were expensive and
difficult to make and it was beyond belief that a
series with different dates should have been obtained.
Again, once the coins had been got into circulation
the counterfeiters would have finished with them.
They would not be trying to get rid of them now.</p>

<p>He set himself to re-examine the samples with
greater care. And the more he did so, the more
convinced of their genuineness he became. So far
as his lens revealed the design, the detail seemed
perfect, the colour, feel, and texture were normal,
and every coin which he tested gave a satisfactory
ring. He would of course have them examined by
the experts at the Mint, but he had little doubt his
own conclusion would be confirmed.</p>

<p>If so, it seemed to follow that the coins had been
stolen. But he could not think of any source from
which they might have been obtained. It was absurd
to suppose they had been taken from the Mint.
Coins of such an age and in such a condition would
not be there. Nor did it seem likely that a bank had
been robbed. Such an operation would be extremely
difficult, and further, if it had been found possible,
it was difficult to see why half crowns alone had been
taken. The only explanation which French could
devise was that some eccentrically minded miser had
spent his life hoarding them. But if so, and Welland
had stolen them, why should he hesitate to pay them
out himself?</p>

<p>On this latter point, however, a little further
thought supplied an explanation. The one feature
of the affair which was clear beyond doubt was that
it was being carried out on a very large scale. If
Miss Moran changed eight hundred half crowns a
week, it was to be presumed that each of the other
girls did the same. Say, three thousand half crowns
a week—150,000 a year! Nearly £19,000 worth.
No one man could do it. Without some such
organization as had been devised, the thing would be
out of the question.</p>

<p>And then French saw that he had made a mistake.
This consideration did not answer his question.
For every half crown Welland gave the girls,
he received one in exchange. How did he get rid
of these latter? <em>How</em> did he get rid of them?</p>

<p>He simply could not do it! He had been watched
too carefully. French did not believe he could have
passed even small things like packages of “snow.”
How much less comparatively bulky bags of half
crowns! Once again French swore, this time half
aloud.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Mr. French?”</p>

<p>His attention was recalled to the girl, whom in his
abstraction he had forgotten.</p>

<p>“Just a little habit of mine,” he said, the twinkle
reappearing in his eyes. “I think that’s all I want.
I’ll take eighty of these half crowns of Welland’s
and give you eighty of mine in exchange. Then you
carry on as usual.”</p>

<p>“Very good, Mr. French.” She paused, then went
on hesitatingly. “I wish you would tell me something
about it. I don’t suppose you could, of course,
but I’m frightfully interested.”</p>

<p>French glanced at her keenly, then smiled.</p>

<p>“I only wish I could,” he answered pleasantly. “If
I knew enough to answer your question I’d be a
much happier man. But I’ll soon know all about it
and I’ll tell you then. In any case, the less you
know, the better for your own health.” Then an
idea occurred to him and he went on: “Tell me, do
you go about London much?”</p>

<p>“Me? No, Mr. French. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean I should imagine that a young lady in
your position with a free forenoon should take some
exercise in the form of walks. Do you not explore
the streets?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Well, yes, I do a little, but I’m
not a great walker.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Avoid the neighbourhood of
Waterloo Station and also Harrow.”</p>

<p>She looked interested.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain,” went on French. “Mr. Welland
lives at Harrow and he garages his car in Tate’s
Lane off York Road. York Road is close to Waterloo.
Now it might be disastrous if he saw you near
either place, as he might imagine you were spying
on him. So keep away from both districts.”</p>

<p>French was in a thoughtful mood as he returned
to the Yard. Seldom had he been up against so
clear-cut a problem. Welland was getting hundreds
of half crowns each day; he must be getting rid of
them somehow or he must be storing them somewhere;
how, or where? It seemed impossible that
there could be a difficulty in finding the solution.
French was therefore the more exasperated by his
failure to do so.</p>

<p>In a kind of dream he took the eighty half crowns
to the Mint. To a high official he told his story,
with the result that immediate investigations and
tests were put in hand. He had a long wait, but
before he left he got his information. All the half
crowns were genuine; no such coins had been recalled
to the Mint; no disused cellar existed in which such
coins might have been kept; no half crowns had been
stolen.</p>

<p>This of course was final proof of the falsity of
the tale Welland had told Molly, which so far as
it went was to the good. But it made the entire
operations of the gang even more inexplicable. If
they were not getting rid of counterfeit coins, what
under heaven were they doing? French’s brain
reeled as he faced the problem.</p>

<p>He walked slowly back to the Yard, full of
bewilderment and baffled rage. These people were
changing one lot of perfectly good half crowns for
another. In spite of the magnitude of the numbers
dealt with, they were getting in no half crowns from
outside nor were they disposing of any. At least,
they certainly were not obtaining nor distributing
anything like the number passed by the girls. What
was it all for?</p>

<p>A sudden wild hooting of a motor horn and frenzied
cries from passers-by recalled French to his
surroundings. He sprang practically from beneath the
bonnet of a heavily laden bus—only just in time.
For quite a hundred yards he forgot about Welland
and his half crowns as he meditated upon the
undesirability of dreaming in the London streets.
Then his thoughts swung back again to his problem.</p>

<p>Whether it was due to the start he had received
or whether it arose in the normal processes of
thought, he immediately found himself considering
a new idea. Suppose all these apparently
contradictory premises were true? Suppose Welland <em>was</em>
neither obtaining half crowns nor disposing of
them? Suppose he <em>was</em> changing one perfectly good
lot of them for another? What if the half crowns
he obtained from the girls on one day were handed
back to them on the next? What if this elaborate
machinery was simply a blind to cover some more
sinister proceedings? Had Molly Moran lied and
were the gang selling drugs after all?</p>

<p>Admittedly French did not see how such a scheme
would facilitate the distribution of cocaine or heroin,
but this problem seemed to him the lesser of the two.
At all events there must be more in it than half
crowns.</p>

<p>But lengthy pondering over it produced no light.
Every solution that occurred to him seemed more
improbable than the last.</p>

<p>In despair he returned to the idea that the disposal
of the half crowns was the essential. Suppose
a hoard of half crowns had been stolen, some
of which were known to be marked? Most unlikely
admittedly, but at least this theory covered the facts.</p>

<p>In his efforts to carry the thing a step further he
tried a trick which had frequently helped him out
of a similar tight place. If when following a trail
of footsteps he came to hard ground on which
they were not visible, he made a cast and went on
to the next soft area in the hope of picking them
up again. Now he made a mental cast. Assuming
Welland were getting rid of these coins changed by
the girls, and leaving out the means by which it was
being done, what must be their eventual destination?</p>

<p>Long cogitation told him that the man’s only
plan must be to pay them in to a bank. In no other
way that French could see could he realize their
value.</p>

<p>This at least opened out an obvious line of
research. With a sense of relief at renewed action he
drafted a circular to the managers of the various
banks in London. He was anxious to trace a man
who, he believed, was paying in large numbers of
half crowns to banks. He would be grateful to the
manager if he would make inquiries as to whether
such payments were being made at his bank, and if
so, let him have some particulars on the matter.</p>

<p>For the remainder of that day the inquiry hung
fire, but next morning French was called to the
telephone. The manager of the Knightsbridge Branch
of the London and County Bank believed that he
had some information which might be useful to the
inspector and would be glad if he would call round.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later French was seated in the
manager’s private room.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said Mr. Elwood, “whether I
have brought you on a wild goose chase, but for
nearly a year a man has been paying in some four
to six hundred half crowns each Wednesday
afternoon. It is common enough to have a weekly payment
of silver, but uncommon to have it restricted to
coins of one denomination. When therefore I
received your circular I thought that this might be
the man you wanted.”</p>

<p>“Sounds hopeful,” French agreed cheerily.
“Perhaps you would give me the details?”</p>

<p>The manager touched a bell. “Mr. Whitley,”
he said, as a dark, keen-looking young man entered,
“you might answer any questions that Mr. French
here asks you about Mr. Welland, of Acacia
Avenue, Harrow.”</p>

<p>“Welland?” exclaimed French in amazement.
“Is he a well-built, prosperous looking man with
the typical American business-man type of face?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” returned the clerk. “Mr. Welland is
slight, with a pale complexion and a small, fair
moustache. He has peculiar eyes, light blue and
with a queer sort of stare.”</p>

<p>A wave of excitement swept over French.
“Style!” he thought, in high delight. Things were
beginning to move at last!</p>

<p>“I think I recognize the man you mean, Mr.
Whitley,” he said pleasantly, “though I knew him
under another name. Now what about this Mr.
Welland? When did you come across him first?”</p>

<p>“He came in one day about a year ago.” The
clerk hesitated. “If I might get my books I could
give you the exact date.”</p>

<p>The manager nodded and in a few moments the
young man returned with a voluminous ledger.</p>

<p>“He first called on the seventeenth of August last
and said he wished to open an account. You may
remember, sir,” Mr. Whitley turned to the manager,
“that I brought him in to you. He said that he
carried on business as a bookmaker and that he dealt
particularly in betting on dog races. He had worked
out a scheme whereby his bets were limited to half
crowns and multiples of a half crown, with the result
that he found himself with large numbers of half
crowns on his hands. His lodgments would therefore
be made in coins of this denomination. On
that day he lodged sixty pounds’ worth of half
crowns. It was a Wednesday and every Wednesday
since then he has come in with amounts varying
from fifty to a hundred pounds all in half crowns.”</p>

<p>“I follow you,” said French. “I take it then that
his account has been steadily growing?”</p>

<p>“No,” the young man returned, “for he draws
cheques for comparatively large amounts at intervals.
I do not think that his account has ever stood
at more than five hundred pounds. When it amounts
to from four to five hundred pounds he draws all out
except a few pounds.”</p>

<p>“By cheque?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by cheque.”</p>

<p>“In whose favour?”</p>

<p>“In his own.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I need scarcely ask you, Mr. Whitley,
if you were satisfied that this business was perfectly
in order? Did it not strike you as strange that
a man should lodge nothing but half crowns?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” the young man returned, “he
explained that, otherwise I probably would have
thought it odd.”</p>

<p>“Then it is not an uncommon thing for silver to
be lodged in that way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, quite common. Small shopkeepers and
persons of that class generally make a weekly lodgment
in silver, but of course it is in coins of all
denominations.”</p>

<p>“Quite. Does Mr. Welland call about the same
time each Wednesday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, always about two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said French. “With your permission,
sir,” he turned to the manager, “I shall be
here at two o’clock next Wednesday, that is
tomorrow, to meet Mr. Welland. I may say that I
believe the information you have given me will prove
highly important and I need scarcely impress on you
both the absolute importance of saying nothing of
my visit and of giving no warning to Mr. Welland.”</p>

<p>French’s mind was in a whirl as he left the bank.
Then it <em>was</em> half crowns! But what was the object
of it all? He swore impotently as he came up once
more against the problem.</p>

<p>But one thing at least was altogether splendid!
For some time past he believed he had had sufficient
evidence against Style to convict him of murder,
but his difficulty had been that Style had vanished.
Now Style was found, or at least he would be
on the next day. That was two of the known members
of the gang. With luck the shadowing of Style
would lead him to the third, Gwen Lestrange. This
morning had marked a great forward step in the
investigation.</p>

<p>But when he reached the Yard French’s delight
increased tenfold. There were awaiting him two
other telephone messages and two letters, all from
the managers of banks and all containing similar
news. In each case the manager advised him that
in reply to his circular he believed the wanted man
was dealing at his bank, and each suggested a call
for further information.</p>

<p>During the afternoon French was a busy man.
Engaging a taxi, he drove round the various branches
and in each found that Style was making a lodgment
of half crowns, exactly as had been described by
the clerk at Knightsbridge. Only on one point
did the stories differ. Each bank was visited by
Style on a different day of the week. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday’s visits
were accounted for, and on ringing up the Yard
from the last branch he visited French was able
to place Thursday’s call also. A similar
communication had come in from still another bank.</p>

<p>With this information he felt that he should soon
reach a decisive stage in the case. Style once
located, the end was in sight.</p>

<p>But he racked his brains in exasperation as his
former problem recurred to him. Again, how was
Welland passing these coins to Style? The more
French thought over the investigation he had made,
the more impossible it seemed that the man could
be doing it. And yet here was definite proof that
it was being done daily.</p>

<p>He sat down at his desk, and contrary to his
usual custom in the office, lit his pipe and began
to smoke with long, steady pulls, as he gave himself
up to thought. For the <i>n</i>th time he visualized the
whole proceedings; the placing of the coins in the
secret panel of the car by the girls; the driving of
the car to the garage; Welland’s walk to his office;
his journey to Harrow; his game of golf; his return
next day to his office; his walk to the garage and the
taking out of the car. Every one of these had been
checked and rechecked so often that it was
impossible—<em>impossible</em>—that the coins could have been
got rid of. And yet they had been.</p>

<p>French wondered if he could not narrow the issue.
The coins definitely reached the garage because
observation showed that they were not taken out of the
car in the streets. Though it was by no means
demonstrated, he inclined to the opinion that when
Welland left the garage he did not take the coins
with him. The man seldom carried anything in his
hand, and so bulky a package could scarcely have
been placed in the pocket without causing a bulge.
But no bulge had been observed. It certainly looked,
therefore, as if the coins were being left in the
garage.</p>

<p>Though his examination had been exhaustive,
French again racked his brains as to whether he
could not have overlooked some means of access to
the garage. Then suddenly an idea occurred to him
which filled him once again with the eager enthusiasm
which every forward step in an investigation
produced.</p>

<p>The drain! Could the drain be a fake? Could it
represent the communication he wanted? He
determined that that very night he would examine it
again.</p>

<p>Accordingly two o’clock next morning saw him
repeat with Sergeant Ormsby the proceedings of
three weeks earlier. Waiting until the policeman
had turned out of Tate’s Lane, they swarmed over
the coachbuilder’s wall, and creeping to the garage,
let themselves in with Ormsby’s key.</p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied about this drain, Ormsby,”
French explained. “I want to make sure that there
is nothing more here than meets the eye. Let’s have
this cover up again.”</p>

<p>They raised the manhole cover and Ormsby got
into the inspection chamber and prepared to examine
the three pipes in turn. French, lying down in the
pit, was able to put his eye to that connecting the
pit to the chamber. Ormsby’s torch lit it completely,
so that every inch was visible. It was a perfectly
clear connection without any break or junction and
French had to admit that nothing was to be learned
from it.</p>

<p>The second pipe from the chamber was the outfall
with the intercepting trap attached. Here also
investigation showed that everything was as it
should be. The trap was full of water, and on Ormsby’s
removing the disc sealing the pipe immediately
above it, a rush of offensive gases came out, proving
that the connection to the sewer was genuine.</p>

<p>There remained therefore only the ventilating
pipe and this, it was obvious, passed under the floor
to the vertical shaft and so to the roof.</p>

<p>“That is all right, Mr. French. You needn’t
worry about it. It is just an ordinary vent pipe,”
Ormsby declared.</p>

<p>But French still was not satisfied.</p>

<p>“I must make sure of the connection,” he said.
“Couldn’t you get up on the roof, Ormsby, and pour
some water down and see if it comes out here?”</p>

<p>The pipe passed out through the roof at the back
of the garage, opposite the door. With some
difficulty Ormsby climbed on the wall between the yard
and the adjoining property, then shuffling up the
roof, poured down the pipe the canful of water
which French handed up. A gurgling sound followed
by a rush of water into the inspection chamber
showed immediately that the connection was good.</p>

<p>“Curse it all,” thought French in disgust, “this
darned thing is no good either. I suppose it must be
that confounded office after all.”</p>

<p>“Did it come all right?” said Ormsby, re-entering
the garage and looking into the inspection chamber.
“I thought you wouldn’t get anything there, Mr.
French. The thing is perfectly normal.” He
climbed down once more into the inspection chamber
and began pushing his rule up the ventilating
pipe.</p>

<p>French watched him idly while he stood racking
his brains over the problem. Then a sudden
exclamation from Ormsby attracted his attention.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked sharply. “Got
anything?”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure, Mr. French. Here’s a queer
thing and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” said French, bending over the
chamber.</p>

<p>“Why, here.” Ormsby measured the distance
along the floor from the chamber to the vertical
pipe. It was just three feet four.</p>

<p>“Now see here,” he said.</p>

<p>Again he got into the chamber and pushed the
rule into the horizontal pipe. French watched
breathlessly as the three-foot rule disappeared and
after it the man’s entire arm!</p>

<p>“There you are, Mr. French,” Ormsby declared.
“That pipe goes through. The vent pipe is only
fixed on to a tee, not a bend. Let’s find how far it
goes.”</p>

<p>Eagerly Ormsby went out, and looking round the
yard, brought in some thin laths. One of these he
pushed up the pipe, then tying on the others, like
the lengths of a fishing rod, pushed the whole in. It
made a length of about ten feet—three times the
distance to the vertical vent pipe. At the end of the
ten feet it brought up against something hard.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea, Ormsby? What can that pipe
be for?”</p>

<p>“Not for ventilation, Mr. French, I’ll swear. If
it only went a foot beyond the vertical pipe I
shouldn’t be so sure, for the builder might have an
old tee that he wanted to use. But this has been
carried on deliberately for at least another five feet.”</p>

<p>“Through the wall?”</p>

<p>“Through the wall. I’d like to see the end of
that pipe in the next lot.”</p>

<p>French swore delightedly.</p>

<p>“So you shall, Ormsby,” he chuckled. “We’ll
get across now and have a look. Get your sticks out
and this manhole cover on so that the place’ll be as
we found it.”</p>

<p>They removed the traces of their visit, and shutting
off their torches, crept out once more into the
darkness of the night.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch14">

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br/> The Property Adjoining</h2>

<p>The two men halted when they had relocked the
door behind them, looking around and listening.</p>

<p>The night was intensely dark. There was no
moon and a thick pall of cloud cut off even the
meagre light of the stars. Above the wall bounding
Tate’s Lane they could see the upper stories of the
houses opposite lit up faintly by the street lamps.
Elsewhere not a gleam of light showed. It was
silent also. Save for the complaining call of a
marauding cat and the distant whistle of a train, no
sound broke the stillness.</p>

<p>Satisfied that they were unobserved, Ormsby made
a “back” and French swung himself up on to the
wall dividing the two properties. Ormsby followed
and both men dropped softly to the ground at the
other side.</p>

<p>“This is what we want,” whispered French as he
felt along a building beside them. “Here’s where
our pipe goes to all right.”</p>

<p>It was another shed, identical, so far as they
could make out in the darkness, with the garage and
set end to end with it.</p>

<p>“We must get in,” went on French. “Have a try
at the lock.”</p>

<p>“It’s a chubb like the other,” returned Ormsby.
“There’s not much chance of getting it open.” He
fumbled for a moment, then: “By Jove! I can do it
after all. The same key fits both. Here you are,
Mr. French. A bit of luck, that is.”</p>

<p>“It’s proof the same parties are running the two,
though we scarcely needed that. Come in and close
the door.”</p>

<p>The door shut, French cautiously turned on his
torch. The shed was a garage, identical in design
with Welland’s. Here were the same cement
finished walls and floor, the same window, pit and
bench, the same manhole cover and ventilating pipe.
There was no car, but there was something a good
deal more interesting. Hanging from hooks beneath
the bench was a twelve-foot sewer cleaners’
“serpent,” a flexible rod with a pair of toothed jaws
at one end operated by a bowden wire from the
other.</p>

<p>“There,” said French, pointing to the rod.
“There’s the proof we wanted. That’s what he uses
to get the bags of half crowns through the pipe.
But to set the thing beyond doubt, Ormsby, you
better go back into that other garage and flash your
light into the pipe. I’ll watch this end.”</p>

<p>While he was away French made a sketch of the
pipes for his report. A copy is given here.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A schematic diagram showing       a cross section of the two garages, separated by a wall, but       with an underground pipe communicating between them.

</figure>

<p>Presently a muffled voice came from the drain and
French, crouching down in the inspection chamber,
saw Ormsby’s torch in the distance.</p>

<p>“That’s that,” French whispered down the pipe.
“Come back and we’ll have a look round here.”</p>

<p>They now essayed a more difficult task. Starting
from the garage, they felt their way along the
various walls, pacing their lengths and estimating the
angles between them. It was not easy work in the
dark, but French was too much afraid of being
overlooked to use his torch. When they had worked
round to their starting point they returned to the
garage, where French made a sketch from his
measurements.</p>

<p>The area appeared to be a yard, irregular in
shape and surrounded by buildings. From the nature
of the debris which filled one corner, old crates
mostly, the place seemed more like a shop or works
than a private house. Opposite the garage an
arched roadway passed under one of the buildings,
ending in a pair of close-sheeted gates. A gleam of
light beneath the gates indicated that they opened
on to a street.</p>

<p>“I want to mark that entrance gate,” French said
as he put away his sketch. “We must locate it in
the street outside.” He paused in thought. “I
have it,” he went on. “Here is a penny. We’ll
push it out underneath and then go round and see
if we can find it.”</p>

<p>They carried out this programme. Having made
sure that they had left no traces of their visit, they
locked the garage, pushed the penny beneath the
large gate, and climbed back, first into the builder’s
yard and then into Tate’s Lane. Then walking
round the block to the parallel street, Killowen
Street, they began searching for a likely gateway.
There were a number of such, but at the third they
found their penny and knew that they had reached
their goal.</p>

<p>The entrance stood beside a shop, and when
French read its signboard he felt amazed and
puzzled. It bore the legend, “Theobald &amp; Grudgin.
Working Silversmiths.”</p>

<p>“Je‑hoshaphat! Can it be coining after all?” he
whispered in bewilderment. If so, what about the
report from the Mint? That report amounted to
practical proof that counterfeit coins were not being
passed. And now here was at least extremely
suggestive evidence that they were! He swore his
comprehensive oath, but it scarcely brought its
customary relief.</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if those Mint people had been
diddled like ourselves,” he muttered. “Well, Ormsby,
that’s all we can do now. We’ll get off home.”</p>

<p>He wondered if it would be wise after all to return
to the silversmiths’ next morning, or rather that
morning, for it was after four o’clock. What he
wanted was to get his hands on Style; the activities
at the silversmiths’ could wait. If he went to
Theobald &amp; Grudgin’s he might be seen by some member
of the gang. The alarm would then be given and
the members might disperse, greatly increasing the
difficulties of rounding them up. No, on second
thoughts he would lie low for the morning. He
would visit the bank at two o’clock and there either
arrest Style or shadow him to his home, the latter
probably, as it might lead him to Gwen Lestrange
and perhaps still other members of the gang.</p>

<p>But next morning a fresh development took place
which banished all thoughts of finesse and sent
him hotfoot to the silversmiths’ and any other place
from which news of the trio might be obtained.</p>

<p>He had been busy at routine work in connection
with the case. He had begun by ringing up the
inspector of the York Road district to ask for such
information as might be available about Messrs.
Theobald &amp; Grudgin and their establishment. Then
he had gone down to the Mint to report his discovery
and to ask as tactfully as he could whether
a mistake might not have been made in their half
crown diagnosis.</p>

<p>The very senior officer who received him had been
emphatic in his reply. No mistake could possibly
have been made. The tests gave absolutely conclusive
results. Silversmiths or no silversmiths, the
coins he had sent them were genuine.</p>

<p>Scarcely had French returned to the Yard when
the blow fell. As he sat down at his desk his
telephone rang.</p>

<p>“Is that Mr. French, the inspector?” asked a
woman’s voice which French vaguely remembered,
but could not place. “I’m Mrs. Creuse, of 27
Nelson Street.”</p>

<p>Nelson Street! Of course, the proprietor of
Molly Moran’s boarding house.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Creuse. Inspector French speaking.
Anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“It’s about Miss Moran,” the voice went on.
“She did not come back after the performance last
night and I’m anxious about her. I shouldn’t have
thought anything about it only for your inquiries
here. A girl sometimes goes home with friends and
is not always careful to ring up her boarding house.
But she was always careful that way.”</p>

<p>French’s heart almost stood still for a moment.
Was it possible. . . ? Could these infernal
scoundrels have got hold of her as they got hold of
Thurza Darke and her two unhappy predecessors?</p>

<p>“Did you not ring up the cinema?” he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but by the time I began to get anxious it
was too late. You see, it’s often nearly twelve
before Miss Moran gets home, and it was only by
chance that I was up myself about one and discovered
she had not arrived. I rang up the cinema first
thing this morning, but I’ve only just got through.
They say she never turned up to business yesterday.
I hope she’s all right.”</p>

<p>French stiffened, sure that this confirmed his worst
fears. Why, <em>why</em> had not the Panopticon people
rung him up? Grimly he promised himself a straight
talk with the manager. But that could wait. Now
the urgent matter was to organize a search.</p>

<p>In times of emergency French always rose to the
occasion. Pausing only to ring up the Panopticon
for confirmation of the landlady’s statement, he set
to work. For some thirty seconds he sat motionless,
staring with unseeing eyes at the polished wood
of his desk, while he rapidly considered the measures
he would take. Then deliberately, but without the
loss of a moment, he proceeded to put his plans into
operation.</p>

<p>His first step was to hurry to Chief Inspector
Mitchell’s room, tell him the news, and outline his
proposals for dealing with the situation. French
already held warrants for the arrest of all three
known members of the gang, but he now wanted
search warrants for Welland’s house and office as
well as for the premises of the silversmiths, Messrs.
Theobald &amp; Grudgin. With all his proposals
Mitchell expressed his agreement.</p>

<p>French next summoned a number of men to his
room.</p>

<p>“I think you all know something of the case I’m
on,” he began, speaking in quiet but impressive
tones. “Starting with the Portsmouth murder, I
have found that a gang of crooks have murdered
three cinema pay-box girls who they feared were
about to give away their secrets to the police. Now
I’ve just had a phone that a fourth girl has
disappeared—a Miss Molly Moran, employed in the
box office of the Panopticon Cinema in Leicester
Square. You have seen her, Carter, and you also,
Harvey. She got into the clutches of the gang,
same as the other three girls, and has been working
for them. Only the day before yesterday she told
me her story, and it looks as if they may have got
wise to it and done her in.”</p>

<p>He paused and the men nodded in silence.</p>

<p>“She left her boarding house in Nelson Street,
so I am advised, at her usual time yesterday morning
and has not been heard of since. If these people
have got her you will see that we can’t lose any
time.”</p>

<p>Again the men nodded, and French went on with
his directions.</p>

<p>“You, Carter, will take two men and bring in
Curtice Welland. Here is a warrant which I have
had ready for some time. Here is his description
and the places, so far as we know, where he is likely
to be found. I leave all the details to you. But
no bungling! Bring him in, and quickly.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Carter promptly disappeared and French
turned to the next in the line.</p>

<p>“I want you, Harvey, to go into the affair at the
Panopticon Cinema. You may get a line on some
caller or hear of a letter or telephone. Advise the
Yard if you have any luck.”</p>

<p>Harvey disappeared in his turn, and French
resumed.</p>

<p>“You, Pickford, try the boarding house. Here is
the address and all particulars. I need scarcely
prompt you. You know what to do.”</p>

<p>So the wheels of the ponderous machine of the
C.I.D. began to creak and relentlessly the great
trap was set. In addition to Carter and his helpers,
men were sent to watch all the places which Welland
was known to frequent: his house, his office, the
garage, his golf club. Inquiries were to be made
from his housekeeper, the other occupiers of the
office buildings, the staff in the coachbuilder’s yard
and the secretary and other members of the golf
club. The three other girls known to be in the
clutches of the gang were to be shadowed and any
member of the gang seen approaching them was
instantly to be secured. Men were despatched to
each of the six banks at which Style had lodged half
crowns, in case he should be seized with a desire to
withdraw his money. The last inquiry French
reserved for himself. “Ormsby,” he concluded, “you
and I will go and have a look round that silversmiths’
yard. I’ve got a search warrant, but I’ll
not use it if I can avoid it. Better get a couple of
men to watch the door while we’re inside.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later French and Ormsby turned
into Killowen Street and walked in a leisurely way
towards Messrs. Theobald &amp; Grudgin’s establishment.
The big gate under which they had pushed
the penny was open and without hesitation they
entered. The entry led through the house to the yard
at the back. In the corner immediately opposite
stood the garage, and from it, across the back end
of the yard, ran the wall separating the premises
from the coachbuilder’s establishment adjoining.
The remaining sides were bounded by buildings, all
dirty and in bad repair. Three doors, one open,
gave on the yard. Another door, apparently from
the office or shop, opened into the side wall of the
entry. The yard also was dirty and heaps of old
boxes and other rubbish lay in corners.</p>

<p>French stood for a moment motionless, taking in
these details and noting with satisfaction the
accuracy of his sketch plan. Then he walked slowly to
the open door.</p>

<p>He found himself on the threshold of a fair-sized
workshop, fitted up with several benches and
a few simple looking machines. In one corner stood
a gas oven with crucibles, presumably for melting
the silver. Close by was what looked like a tiny
foundry. Several of the benches bore small lathes
but most of the simple machinery was for smoothing
and polishing. The place looked as if at one time
it might have been busy and successful, but now it
had been allowed to go to seed. Like the yard it was
dirty and untidy and its entire staff consisted of
three old men, dirty and untidy also and clearly past
their work. One was busy at the gas oven as if
about to make a cast, the others were filing up and
polishing silver ornaments.</p>

<p>“Could I see the manager?” French asked after
giving the men a pleasant good morning.</p>

<p>The man from the gas oven turned off a tap and
slowly approached.</p>

<p>“ ’E ain’t in yet, so far as I knows,” he said.
“You’ve tried the office?”</p>

<p>“Not there,” French declared mendaciously.</p>

<p>“Aye. Well, ’e ain’t come in. ’E usually comes
in in ’is car abaht ten or ’alf past, but this morning
’e ain’t turned up yet. Was you wanting anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I want a quotation for a silver trowel and
casket for laying a foundation stone. But I expect
I’d better see the boss about it.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the man again. “There ain’t no one
’ere as could tell you abaht that. Take a seat in
the office, mister. The boss won’t be long.”</p>

<p>“I can wait. I’m not in a hurry.” French took
out his cigarette case and held it out. “I think I
know your boss,” he resumed conversationally, “but
I’m hanged if I haven’t forgotten his name. He’s a
rather slight man of middle height with a pale
complexion and a small fair moustache, isn’t he? Rather
staring eyes?”</p>

<p>“That’s ’im, mister. You’ve ’it ’im off abaht
proper. Welland, they calls ’im. Mr. Curtice
Welland.”</p>

<p>“Welland! Of course. I remember now. Lives
out at Harrow?”</p>

<p>“Blowed if I could tell. ’E ain’t never asked me
’ome to dinner.”</p>

<p>“That’s his loss,” said French with a smile. He
glanced casually round the workshop. “Fine place
you have here. Too big for three men surely?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head despondingly.</p>

<p>“It were a good shop once, but times is not wot
they were. I’ve seen the day when there were twenty
men working in this ’ere shop and doing good work
and plenty of it. And now there’s only three of us
left and there ain’t much for us to do neither. It
were a bad day for us when the old master sold
out.”</p>

<p>“Then the works have changed hands?”</p>

<p>“Aye, abaht a year ago. Old Mr. Grudgin ’ad it;
Mr. Theobald, ’e were dead this five year. I s’pose
Mr. Grudgin were feeling it too much for ’im; ’e
were seventy if ’e were a day. So ’e sold it to this
’ere Mr. Welland, and”—the old man paused, finally
adding—“some’ow the work fell off and most of the
men were sacked. But Lord knows I ain’t got no
cause to complain! I’m ’ere still, though younger
men than me got the boot.”</p>

<p>“It’s been a terrible time for trade right enough,”
French declared sympathetically. “And yours is
what you might call a luxury trade, so you would
feel bad times worse than most.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, mister.”</p>

<p>“What kind of work do you do mostly?” went
on French with the forced interest of a man who
has time to put away.</p>

<p>“We used to do all kinds, statuettes and plaques
and trophy cups and vases and medallions and such
like. But we don’t do much now; lids for inkpots
and penholders and backs for fancy clothes brushes
and stoppers for toilet bottles for suitcases: that’s
abaht all.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Mr. Welland looks after sales
himself? You haven’t a traveller?”</p>

<p>“No, there ain’t nobody now but Mr. Welland
and the boy wot you saw in the office.”</p>

<p>French chatted on in a leisurely way, moving
about the shop as he did so. He did not learn much
from the man’s conversation, but he satisfied himself
that, except possibly in some secret cellar, no coining
was in progress. Such articles as still were being
made, so the old man assured him, went from the
workshop to the office, where Welland, to give
him that name, disposed of them. Of this side of
the business the workman knew nothing. The silver
came in the form of bars or ingots, usually by
motor lorry. It was stored in the shed adjoining
Welland’s garage, a strongly built shed of which
only Welland had the key. Where it came from
the man did not know.</p>

<p>Seeing that no further information was to be had,
French explained that he did not think he could
wait for Mr. Welland that day, but that he would
call again. Then wishing the old man good day,
he left the yard.</p>

<p>Ormsby was waiting for him in the archway.</p>

<p>“Style’s running this place under the name of
Welland,” French said to him in a low tone. “Took it
over about a year ago. It seems there’s a boy in the
office. I’m going to make a search. Come in with
me.”</p>

<p>Ormsby nodded and the two men, passing out
into the street, turned into the shop.</p>

<p>A glass door, which rang a bell on being opened,
led into a dark and untidy showroom. Across the
front was a counter, with behind it a row of show
cases containing plaster models. These cases acted
as a screen, cutting off the office portion behind. In
the background were a small green safe, a letter file
and two desks. One, a roll-top, was closed, the
other was a high desk with a brass rail bookstand
above. The back wall was pierced by a window giving
on to the yard, while in the side wall was the
door leading to the entry. Some dirty calendars
and advertisement plates hung crookedly here and
there.</p>

<p>At the high desk sat a youth of about twenty
with a pen in his hand and a ledger spread out before
him. French thought he had never seen anyone in
the position of clerk who looked so utterly devoid
of intelligence. He watched him make a clumsy
attempt to hide a well-thumbed novelette with a
lurid picture on the cover, then said pleasantly:
“Could I see Mr. Welland, please?”</p>

<p>The youth pushed the novelette into his pocket
and slowly advanced to the counter.</p>

<p>“ ’E ain’t ’ere,” he replied succinctly.</p>

<p>“So I observe,” said French, looking carefully
round the room. “Do you know when he will be
in?”</p>

<p>“Naw.”</p>

<p>French fixed the youth with a severe eye.</p>

<p>“Now, sonny,” he said sharply. “We’re police
officers and we’re looking for Mr. Welland. When
was he here last?”</p>

<p>The youth gaped and it took a repetition of the
question in a still sharper tone to wake him up.</p>

<p>“Yesterday morning,” he answered sullenly.</p>

<p>Style, it appeared, had arrived at the works at
his usual hour, about half past ten. Customarily he
remained till one o’clock, when he left for lunch.
But on this occasion he had only waited a few
minutes. He had sent the youth out on a message, and
when the latter returned half an hour later he had
disappeared. The youth had not seen him since.</p>

<p>French was not satisfied.</p>

<p>“What was the message?” he asked.</p>

<p>It was a bow drawn at a venture with the general
object of amassing detailed knowledge, but to his
amazement the arrow got in between the joints of
Style’s armour.</p>

<p>“Postal order for two bob,” the youth returned.</p>

<p>“That shouldn’t have taken you half an hour.”</p>

<p>“ ’E didn’t want no order,” the youth declared,
and his eyes looked sly and furtive. “ ’E only
wanted me out of the way.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p>The youth smiled, a sort of sickly leer, unpleasant
to look upon.</p>

<p>“The gal,” he remarked laconically.</p>

<p>“The girl? What girl?”</p>

<p>“The gal as came in with him.”</p>

<p>“A tall, strong, well-built girl with fair hair and
complexion and blue eyes?” French suggested
eagerly, believing he was on the track of Gwen
Lestrange.</p>

<p>“Naw. Small and dark.”</p>

<p>French leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“What!” he roared, scaring the youth almost into
fits.</p>

<p>Molly Moran! He paused, thrilled at the
thought, then sat down again.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he declared. “I was surprised
for the moment. Now tell me all about this girl.
When did she come?”</p>

<p>Getting information from the youth was like getting
treacle out of a test tube, but by the exercise
of all his patience French managed it.</p>

<p>It seemed that when Style arrived he had driven
his car into the yard in accordance with his usual
custom. It was a dark green Armstrong Siddeley
saloon. But instead of garaging it he had turned
it and run it back into the entry, stopping opposite
the office door. Then he had hurried back to the
street. Evidently Molly—further questions had left
French in no doubt as to the “gal’s” identity—had
been waiting for him, for both came at once into
the office. Style had asked her to sit down and had
then excused himself on urgent business in the
workshops. A few moments later the speaking tube
from the workshops had whistled. It was Style and
he had instructed the youth to go out immediately
and buy a two-shilling postal order. Such a thing
had never been asked for before and the youth did
not believe it was required. He had therefore
assumed that the errand was to get him out of the
way in order to allow the tender passages between
Style and his caller which he imagined were desired.
In this belief he had improved the opportunity to
visit a friend, the message boy in a neighbouring
shop, and he was not back for half an hour. Style
and the young lady had then gone.</p>

<p>French made a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>“After my warning! After my warning!” he
lamented in a low voice to Ormsby. “How under
the sun did that scoundrel get her into his power?”</p>

<p>He turned again to the youth.</p>

<p>“We’re going to search this place,” he said
sharply. “Here’s our warrant, if you’d like to see it.
Now hand over any keys you have, then sit down
there and don’t interfere.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he shut and bolted the heavy outer
door. Then ruthlessly silencing the clerk’s timid
protests, the two men began the search.</p>

<p>The safe was beyond them and French put
through a call to the Yard for an expert. The
roll-top desk, however, was easily overcome by means
of French’s skeleton keys. Quickly but thoroughly
the two men turned the place out. For a couple of
hours they worked, first in the office and then in the
workshops behind, before French announced that he
was satisfied.</p>

<p>Though the search had yielded little, that little
was important. No hint as to Style’s possible
whereabouts had been gained nor any information as to
the remaining members of the gang. Still less was
there any hint as to what might have happened to
Molly Moran, though French’s sketch of the tracks
of Style’s car and its detailed description, obtained
from the old workman, might later on help in
tracing her. But two things had been made clear
beyond possibility of doubt. First, the silversmiths’
business was practically non-existent. It was
evidently a mere blind to cover more serious and
lucrative operations. Secondly, though scarcely any
silver articles had been sold, the purchase of bar silver
had been very large.</p>

<p>Report from the Mint or no report, there could
no longer be any doubt as to what was being done.
Coining on an enormous scale was in progress. The
next thing for French must be to find the plant. Or
rather the next thing but one. At all costs Molly
Moran’s life must be saved, were this humanly
possible.</p>

<p>While French was sitting in the office turning
these matters over in his mind, the Yard expert had
not been idle. He now called to them that he had
just succeeded in opening the safe. French began
eagerly to go through its contents. But he found
only one thing of interest, four little leathern bags
shaped to fit the divisions in the vanity bags, each
containing from a hundred to a hundred and fifty
half crowns.</p>

<p>Sure that at last he held the key to the affair, he
poured the coins out on to the desk and examined
them minutely. Immediately he was once again
disappointed. All of them, he was prepared to swear,
were genuine. Every test he applied proved them
so. And then suddenly he wondered. All of them
were dated 1921!</p>

<p>Whether this meant anything or not he did not
know, but it was at least certain that they must at
once be sent to the Mint for an authoritative
opinion.</p>

<p>More anxious than ever as to Molly’s fate,
French returned to the Yard, hoping against hope
that some useful information might have come in.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br/> Mr. Cullimore Expounds</h2>

<p>French was profoundly worried by the
disappearance of Molly Moran. He could not get out
of his mind the thought that if anything happened
to her he was by no means free from responsibility.
There could be no doubt that it was through
him that she had incurred the suspicion of the gang,
and he had led her to believe that she could confide
in him with perfect safety. Bitterly he regretted
his oversight in not having her shadowed so that
her kidnapping would have been impossible. Again
and again he cursed his mistake and again and again
he swore to leave no stone unturned to save her,
and if unhappily he failed in that, to bring her
murderers to justice.</p>

<p>There was little that he could do personally but
remain in his room and collate and sift the
information which soon began to come in. A good deal
was obtained as a result of the inquiries which he
had set on foot, but unfortunately it was all negative.</p>

<p>The first news he had was from the men whom
he had sent to the banks at which Style got rid of
his half crowns. At none of them had the man been
seen. This was Thursday and since Tuesday he had
neither paid in half crowns nor drawn cheques.
The total sum standing to his credit in all six was
close on five hundred pounds. It was evident
therefore that he was badly frightened, if, as seemed
likely, he had abandoned the money.</p>

<p>Telephone reports from the other men engaged
were equally disappointing. Sergeant Harvey rang
up to say that he had been unable to learn anything
at the Panopticon. Miss Moran had left at her
usual time on the Tuesday evening and an assistant
with whom she had walked to the tube said that
her remarks showed that she intended to be at work
on the following day. Nor was any news available
from her boarding house. On the Wednesday evening
she had not turned up after the performance.
That was the desolating fact. She had not sent any
message to explain her absence nor had she previously
given a hint to anyone there that she might
not be home.</p>

<p>Even more disquieting was the report from Carter.
He had been unable to arrest Curtice Welland
because Welland also had disappeared. The man
had not returned home on Wednesday evening nor
had he been seen since. His housekeeper, however,
was not alarmed about him as he had sent her a
telegram on Wednesday afternoon to say that he
was unexpectedly called away on business and would
be absent for a few days. His usual haunts had been
shadowed and exhaustive inquiries made, but all to
no purpose.</p>

<p>The three other box office girls who had been
changing coins were interrogated, also without
result. At first all three had denied that they had
ever met Welland or were engaged in questionable
practices with half crowns, but the police
examination had soon broken them down and they had
admitted their complicity. But all stated that
Wednesday was the last day on which they had seen
Welland. None of them had seen Style for many weeks.</p>

<p>One vitally important piece of information,
however, came in, a piece indeed fundamental to the
whole inquiry. At any other time it would have
raised French to the pitch of exalted enthusiasm
usual to him under such circumstances. But now he
was so worried about Molly Moran’s safety that he
took the news as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Returning to the Yard from a further visit to
the girl’s boarding house in Nelson Street, he found
himself in demand. “Chief wants you, sir,” he
was told by the first three men he met, while
Inspector Tanner, whom he passed on the way to his
room, hailed him with “Hullo, French, my son!
Now you’ve been and gone and done it! There has
been no peace here this morning looking for Brer
French.”</p>

<p>Before French could reply a sergeant approached.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir, but the Assistant Commissioner
wishes to see you in his room as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Lord!” said French. “What’s all the shindy
about? Right, sergeant. I’m going now.”</p>

<p>Sir Mortimer Ellison, the Assistant Commissioner,
was seated at his desk in his well but plainly
furnished office when French entered. With him
were two other men, evidently from their dress and
bearing persons of importance. One was small,
white-haired and precise looking, the other, a
younger man, was evidently his subordinate. All
three were smoking the opulent Turkish cigarettes
which Sir Mortimer affected. The elder of the
visitors was speaking, the others listening with every
appearance of interest.</p>

<p>“Come along, French,” said Sir Mortimer, interrupting
the other’s flow of conversation. “You’ve
turned up in the nick of time. This is the inspector
who has been handling the case, gentlemen. French,
these are Mr. Cullimore and Mr. Dove from the
Mint. They’ve called about that silver bombshell
you sent down.”</p>

<p>“What, sir?” French exclaimed. “Then the coins
were counterfeit all right?”</p>

<p>“All right?” Sir Mortimer waved his hand towards
French and looked quizzically at the others.
“Hear Scotland Yard speak! French, you’ve got a
distorted mind. Revelling in iniquity. Why should
you be pleased because the revered institution which
our friends represent has been the victim of a
fraud?”</p>

<p>French knew his superior.</p>

<p>“Pleased to tell them, sir, that thanks to Scotland
Yard the fraud is at an end,” he said without a
smile.</p>

<p>“There’s Scotland Yard again. When you have
no answer, beg the question. I do it myself, so I
know. Now, French, sit down in that chair and
tell us all about it.”</p>

<p>But French remained standing with a puzzled
expression on his face.</p>

<p>“But what about——” he began, then stopped.</p>

<p>“What is it, French?”</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir. But this can only refer to the second
lot of coins. The first lot were good.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” broke in Mr. Cullimore in thin,
precise tones. “The first batch was good. It is this
second batch alone that is in question.”</p>

<p>“A bit puzzling that, sir,” French went on to
the Assistant Commissioner. “I should have
expected it the other way round. The first batch
was given to the girl Moran to pass out to the
public, the second was in Style’s safe. Why should
they pass out good coins?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got them the wrong way round. That
lot you got from the girl must have been received
from the public, not from the gang.”</p>

<p>French shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’m quite sure of my ground there. Miss
Moran put the coins she got from the public in
the car. What she gave me were taken from the car
for distribution.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then Sir
Mortimer spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, if I can’t prove you in the wrong I must
try something else. How would this do? Those
people are smarter than you’ve been giving them
credit for. They twigged you were on to them
and went canny. Is there any way they could have
known what you were up to?”</p>

<p>“Through the girls, sir,” French admitted. “I
saw the risk, but I had to take it.”</p>

<p>“There you are then. The girls reported your
activities, and Welland, Style &amp; Co. thought it
healthier to trade good money. Well, French, when
these gentlemen rang me up to make an appointment
I expected Chief Inspector Mitchell would be here to
post me in the affair until you got back. But Mitchell
has been detained at Croydon so that I have been
unable to tell them more than the main outlines.
Now you start in from the beginning and let us have
all the details.”</p>

<p>“About the cinema girls, sir?”</p>

<p>“About the silver. I’ve explained the method of
distribution through the cinema girls and that is all
these gentlemen require to know on that point. You
tell about everything connected directly with the
silver.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, sir, there’s not so much to be told.
All I’ve found is——” and French began explaining
his investigations in detail. He told of the distribution
and transport of the coins, the vanity bags, the
secret panel beneath the seat of Welland’s car and
the pipe connecting the two garages. Then he read
out his notes of what he had found in the office,
particularly the weights of silver and copper
purchased compared to the weight of silver ornaments
sold. The three men listened with keen attention,
Mr. Cullimore congratulating him warmly when he
had finished.</p>

<p>“It’s the cleverest fraud I’ve come across for
many a day,” he declared. “Indeed I don’t mind
admitting that if it hadn’t been for our friend here
it might have gone on almost indefinitely. It would
never have been discovered from mere inspection
of the coins. They look perfect. Only careful tests
in our laboratories proved that they were
counterfeit.”</p>

<p>“Made by an expert?” Sir Mortimer prompted.</p>

<p>“Unquestionably. Perfectly marvellous the way
they were turned out! I have shown them to several
of our people and they all said they were good;
men with wide experience too. I don’t wonder that
Miss Moran’s bank clerk friend was deceived. You
see”—Mr. Cullimore monopolized the conversation
with evident pleasure—“there are four principal
tests of a silver coin: its appearance, by which I
include feel and texture as well as design; its weight,
its composition, and its ring. All these tests were
met or discounted, except perhaps that of
composition and that was practically met.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I quite follow you,” said Sir
Mortimer, and French nodded his agreement.</p>

<p>“Well, take composition. The composition of
these coins was the actual composition of the coins
we turn out from the Mint. In other words, the
fake coins were genuine as far as the material of
which they were made was concerned—at least, as
nearly as it could be done without our extraordinarily
accurate system of proportioning the
ingredients. In fact it took our extraordinarily
accurate system to discover the inaccuracy. That is
what I meant by saying that this test of
composition had been practically met.”</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner nodded.</p>

<p>“The proportions of metal in our silver at
present,” went on Mr. Cullimore, “are fifty per cent
silver and fifty per cent alloy, principally copper.
You will see what I mean when I tell you that these
fake coins contained not less than forty-eight point
sixty-three nor more than fifty-one point twelve per
cent of silver, the remainder being alloy. Nothing
there to call one’s attention to a fake!”</p>

<p>“That is so. Yet your people found the
discrepancy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cullimore shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“We did, but we’re not proud of it. The less we
say about that part of the affair the better. My
point is that no one would have suspected anything
wrong from the appearance of the coins.”</p>

<p>Sir Mortimer nodded again.</p>

<p>“You mentioned three other tests?”</p>

<p>“Yes, those of design, weight, and ring. Take
the first of these. Now I’m sure you know, Sir
Mortimer, that no matter how carefully a coin is
copied, defects will creep in. Particles of dust or
slight defects in the original will make a difference.
Admittedly these may be invisible to the naked eye,
but a microscope will reveal them. Any coins struck
as copies, that is, not from the original dies, will be
microscopically defective in the detail of the design.
You follow me?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“Now take weight. This is dependent primarily
on the thickness of the coin and the correct thickness
can only be produced by the elaborate machines
in the Mint. It is scarcely conceivable that a forger
could obtain one of these machines. These two tests
together are therefore very reliable and
convincing.”</p>

<p>“Then surely the fake coins could have been
discovered by these?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” Mr. Cullimore replied, making a little gesture
of demonstration as he reached his point, “that’s
what I thought you’d say and that’s where the
cleverness of this gang comes in. They discounted these
two tests, and that in the simplest and most natural
way imaginable. They wore the coins.”</p>

<p>“Wore them?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In some way which we can only imagine
they produced wear. Our engineers imagine that
they turned them with very fine sand in some kind
of a rotary churn, for the microscope shows that
the wear is really caused by numbers of very fine
scores and cuts. Ordinary wear from circulation,
while it shows occasional cuts and scratches, leaves
a comparatively smooth surface on the higher parts
of the design. But even so, what I might call this
counterfeiting of wear was uncommonly well done.
Here again only the microscope could have told the
difference.”</p>

<p>“And that had the effect——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Mr. Cullimore, determined
not to be cheated of his climax. “Don’t you see?
That had the effect of blurring the design so that
minor defects became invisible and also of lightening
it so that the weight test became inoperative. Clever,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Rather an obvious precaution, I should say,”
the Assistant Commissioner commented, annoyed at
having the words taken out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” the other admitted, “but how to do
it is not so obvious.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all very interesting at all events.
What about the ring?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cullimore sat back and became less
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“The ring?” he repeated. “The ring is not so
easy to explain. It depends on a lot of things, such
as the precise degree of hardness of the coins. Even
with the careful manufacture in the Mint we do not
get all coins to ring alike. All have to be tested
individually, and those which do not ring correctly
are rejected. I fancy our counterfeiters must have
adopted the same plan.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Cullimore finished speaking there was
silence for some seconds. Sir Mortimer busied
himself in handing round fresh cigarettes. When they
were lighted French said:</p>

<p>“There is one point which has been bothering me
since I became satisfied that these people were
coining and that is, How does it pay them? Surely it
must cost at least nearly half a crown to produce a
half crown?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Mr. Cullimore, “it doesn’t.
That’s just the point. It should pay them
uncommonly well. You know, of course,” he went on,
addressing the company generally, “that during
the war the price of silver went up, so that coins
were worth more when melted down than as currency.
This actually led to a considerable loss of
coins. To meet the difficulty the percentage of
silver present was reduced. Formerly it was ninety-two
point five per cent, but in nineteen-twenty it was
reduced to the fifty per cent of which I spoke a
moment ago. Since nineteen-twenty the price of silver
has fallen again. It is now standing at about two
shillings an ounce. The cost of the silver in a half
crown is therefore less than sixpence—let us assume
sixpence. The alloy and the manufacture, including
overhead, might be at the very most another
sixpence. These people could therefore produce a
half crown at a cost of about a shilling, making
eighteenpence profit on each coin. As the law now
stands, that’s the unhappy fact.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” French turned to Sir Mortimer.
“In that case, sir, it prompts one to ask why the
staple industry of the British Isles is not
counterfeit coining?”</p>

<p>“A pertinent question, French. I was considering
it myself. Difficulty of distribution, I presume.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Sir Mortimer,” Mr. Cullimore declared.
“Any skilful man may produce sufficiently
good coins to pass, but it takes a genius to get rid
of enough to pay for the plant. That’s why most
people with these ideas try printing notes. If you
can make eight or nine shillings for every ten-shilling
note you pass the game becomes worth while,
particularly when changing notes is so easy. But
you cannot change half crowns in the same way.
Some system of changing like that of Mr. French’s
friends becomes necessary and that’s where the
trouble arises.”</p>

<p>“That’s where it arose in this case anyway,” said
French. “The distribution was the weak link of the
whole scheme.”</p>

<p>“So it has proved,” Mr. Cullimore admitted. “But
I consider it an extremely clever scheme all the same.
The more you consider the problem involved, the
more you will realize, I think, its enormous
difficulty. Just think, Mr. French. How would you
have done it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Mr. Cullimore,” Sir Mortimer
said gravely. “Don’t make him incriminate himself.
If you ask him questions like that you will
have him telling you that things of the kind are
not done at the Yard.”</p>

<p>French grinned.</p>

<p>“That, sir, <em>is</em> the answer to the question. All the
same if I had to find a scheme I should try to avoid
one which left me in the hands of four box office
girls. That’s what gave the thing away. If the
girls had been members of the conspiracy it might
never have come out. But the fear that the girls
would give the show away led to their doing so.”</p>

<p>“I begin to appreciate the force of your remark,
Sir Mortimer, about the Yard’s habit of begging the
question,” Mr. Cullimore declared drily. “But I
don’t quite appreciate Mr. French’s point. You say,
Mr. French, that the girls gave the scheme away.
But I understood they hadn’t?”</p>

<p>“Not directly, sir. But the gang were afraid they
might and adopted murder to safeguard themselves.
The murder gave them away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite. I see what you mean.” Mr. Cullimore
dismissed the point airily and turned to a new
one. “I suppose there is no way of estimating how
many of these faked half crowns are in existence?”</p>

<p>“You gave me some figures on that, French. Just
turn them up, will you?”</p>

<p>“All I can suggest is this, sir. Miss Moran told
me that she passed out from one hundred to one
hundred and fifty a day. I took a minimum of
between seven and eight hundred a week. If all four
girls were doing the same that would be, say, three
thousand a week or in round numbers a hundred
and fifty thousand a year. We understand that the
conspiracy has been running for about that time.”</p>

<p>“Nearly nineteen thousand pounds’ worth of spurious
money in circulation!” Mr. Cullimore shook
his head. “It’s bad, but it might be worse.”</p>

<p>“And nearly twelve thousand pounds a year
netted,” Sir Mortimer added. “Quite a profitable
little enterprise, particularly if the profits had only
to be divided among three. What will your
department do about it, Mr. Cullimore?”</p>

<p>Mr. Cullimore glanced at him keenly.</p>

<p>“That really is rather a problem, Sir Mortimer,”
he admitted. “To all intents and purposes the
money is good. Moreover, to recall it would be a
virtual impossibility. At present I may as well
admit that I do not see that we can do anything but
accept it as genuine and let it continue to circulate.
Of course I am speaking offhand and without proper
consideration. But that is my present view.”</p>

<p>For some time they continued discussing the
matter and then Mr. Cullimore remarked: “The thing
I cannot get over is the extraordinary skill with
which the coins were turned out. This gang must
surely have some technical training and it’s not a
trade that many men follow. You know nothing, of
course, as to their identity?”</p>

<p>Sir Mortimer shook his head.</p>

<p>“We have their descriptions, though up to the
present it hasn’t helped us much. But I appreciate
your point about technical training, and we shall
certainly make inquiries on these lines.”</p>

<p>“Just the sort of thing that one would expect
from Jim Sibley. What do you say, Mr. Cullimore?”
said a new voice, and French looked with a
sort of surprised interest at Dove, who had not yet
spoken.</p>

<p>“ ’Pon my soul, I shouldn’t be at all surprised to
hear he had something to do with it,” Mr. Cullimore
returned. “He’s the only man I know who could
do such work. You haven’t come across a stout,
red-haired man in your inquiries, I suppose, Sir
Mortimer?”</p>

<p>“Not so far. Who might Jim Sibley be, if it is
not indiscreet to ask?”</p>

<p>“Up till three years ago he was an engineer
employed at the Mint. He was with us for about seven
years and I don’t mind saying that, present company
excepted, he was the most brilliantly clever man it
has ever been my good fortune to meet. There was
nothing about coining he didn’t know and nothing he
couldn’t do with his hands. Extraordinarily
resourceful too. It was a pleasure to see him tackle
a difficulty, especially one which required some
ingenious adaptation of some tool or machine for its
solution. As Mr. Dove says, this coining business
certainly suggests his hand.”</p>

<p>“Why did he leave you, Mr. Cullimore?”</p>

<p>The little man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Rejected coins were disappearing. We were
satisfied that he was stealing them, but we couldn’t
prove it. We asked him to leave.”</p>

<p>“And did the thefts go on?”</p>

<p>“No, when he left there was no further trouble.
There was not the slightest doubt of his guilt, but
he was clever enough to prevent us getting proof.”</p>

<p>Sir Mortimer not commenting, French asked if
Mr. Cullimore would kindly explain what rejected
coins were and what was the object of stealing them.</p>

<p>“By rejected coins I mean those which are complete,
but which fail to pass some of the tests imposed.
For instance, a half crown, otherwise perfect,
might not ring quite true. It would therefore
be rejected and would go back to the furnace to be
remelted. Its value to the thief, who would
presumably put it into circulation, would be just two
and sixpence.”</p>

<p>“That seems a useful hint about this Sibley, sir,”
French said to the Assistant Commissioner. “With
your permission I should like to ask these
gentlemen for further particulars about him.”</p>

<p>“By all means, French. Get what you can out
of them while you have the chance.”</p>

<p>But neither of the visitors could give information
which seemed likely to lead to Sibley’s apprehension.
It was arranged therefore that French should send
a man to the Mint to look up records and learn
what he could from other members of the staff.</p>

<p>“I would go myself, sir,” French went on, “but
I don’t want to leave the Yard for the present. I
want to be here if any news of that girl should
come in.”</p>

<p>“Quite.” Sir Mortimer turned to the others.
“Inspector French is much upset as to the possible
fate of one of the four girls who were changing coins
for these ruffians. After worm—shall I say
‘obtaining her confidence,’ French?—she has disappeared
and there is evidence that she has been kidnapped.
Three of her predecessors were kidnapped
and, I regret to say, murdered, almost certainly
under similar circumstances.”</p>

<p>“When I asked her for her confidence I promised
her protection,” French explained in a low tone.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t blame yourself,” Sir Mortimer declared.
“I appreciate your feelings, but you mustn’t
let sentiment run away with you. You acted for
the best and no one is omniscient.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. But you see why I want to stay
at the Yard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I approve of that. Well, gentlemen,” he
went on to the others, who had risen, “we are much
obliged for your call and information. You may
rest assured that we shall keep you posted in the
developments of the case, and I trust you will advise
us if further information comes to your knowledge.”</p>

<p>“You may depend on us.”</p>

<p>“Our friends are annoyed that we should have
found out about this fraud before they did,” Sir
Mortimer remarked when the visitors had gone. “It
evidently hurts their pride. Now, French, tell me
exactly what you’re doing. You can have all the
resources you want. I quite agree that we must
save that girl’s life if it is humanly possible.”</p>

<p>French detailed his plans.</p>

<p>“Is there anything else, sir, that you think I should
do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, I think you have pretty well covered the
ground. Carry on as you’re doing and let me know
directly anything comes in.”</p>

<p>But nothing did come in. Every hour that passed
made the affair seem more and more hopeless, while
French grew more and more worried and despondent.
That night he scarcely closed an eye, lying
with the telephone beside him and hoping against
hope to hear its bell summoning him to the Yard
to follow up some clue which had just been reported.
But though he had been disturbed on many a night
when he was tired and would have given a good deal
to remain in bed, on this occasion there was no call.</p>

<p>Next day at the Yard there was the same blank
silence. He fretted and fumed through its insufferable
hours until at last he told himself that he
must give up hope and began to fear that the only
news he could expect would be that of the finding
of the unhappy girl’s body. And then late in the
evening his weariness and lassitude changed to fierce
energy and excitement. News had come in!</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br/> In the Net</h2>

<p>French’s conversation with Molly Moran had
given that young lady very seriously to think. From
the beginning she had realized that the undertaking
in which she was assisting was unlawful, if not
actually criminal. She was not making a bid for
French’s sympathy when she told him that since she
had become involved she had been miserable and in
terror. This was the literal truth. Continually she
had felt as if she were living on the edge of a
volcano which might break out and overwhelm her at
any moment. Visions of dismissal, of imprisonment,
of ruin were constantly before her and in
spite of the money she was earning she would have
been thankful if she could have given up the whole
thing and removed its evil shadow from her life.</p>

<p>But never in her wildest imaginings had she conceived
that the affair could be weighted with murder
or she herself in actual physical danger. The story
of Thurza Darke and her two predecessors had
therefore come to her as an appalling shock. Indeed,
she realized that had it come alone she might
easily have been driven by panic to take some step
which might have precipitated the very crisis she
feared.</p>

<p>Fortunately it had not come alone. The same
conversation had brought her a feeling of
overwhelming relief. She had confided her position to
Scotland Yard. She had made a clean breast of
everything. And she had not been arrested nor
made to suffer any unpleasantness whatever. On
the contrary she had been met with a sympathetic
understanding such as she could not have expected
from a police officer. She had been promised escape
from the toils in which she had been caught as well
as protection against her captors. In spite of the
dark suggestion of murder, as she returned from
the manager’s room to her box office she felt
happier than she had done for months.</p>

<p>During the remainder of that day it must be
confessed that her thoughts were far from her job.
Mechanically she counted change and shot out disc
tickets while she speculated as to the developments
which would take place as a result of her statement
to French. Would Westinghouse, Style, and Gwen
Lestrange be arrested? If so, would she be a
witness at their trial? She had always heard that
giving evidence was a distressing ordeal, especially
if one were cross-examined, as she would be by the
lawyers for the defence. However, she was sure
that French would see her through.</p>

<p>Excitement kept her awake for a good part of
that night and next morning she came down with
her mind keyed up to a high pitch of expectancy.
What would the day bring forth? Surely with the
knowledge the police now had, some decisive step
would be taken before night.</p>

<p>After breakfast she found herself with three
hours on her hands before she must present herself
at the cinema. Too restless to settle down at her
boarding house, she determined to go for a walk
in the parks, in the hope that the exercise might
calm her mind. She was bursting to confide her
story to all and sundry, but French’s warning as well
as her own fears deprived her of this relief.</p>

<p>As she walked, that other warning which French
had given her seemed to stand out in her mind with
an ever growing insistence. Those addresses, the
two places to which she must not go! The further
she walked, the more powerfully they drew her
thoughts. That at Harrow did not so greatly interest
her: it was far away. But Waterloo was near.
She had been there scores of times. Not indeed in
York Road, but close by. She would have liked . . .
But of course she couldn’t dream of going
there after what Mr. French had said.</p>

<p>She turned resolutely into the Green Park, but
ever her thoughts reverted to the coachbuilder’s
yard. Presently without conscious volition on her
part she found herself leaving the Park and walking
in the direction of the River. “This will never
do,” she thought; then she saw that it could not
possibly be any harm for her just to walk past the
end of the street and look down. She had an uneasy
twinge of conscience as she crossed Westminster
Bridge, but the place drew her with extraordinary
insistence.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later she found herself actually turning
into Tate’s Lane. But here she drew the line.
French had said she was not to go and she would
not. Therefore contenting herself with a long,
eager look down the unattractive thoroughfare, she
put temptation behind her and passed on.</p>

<p>But still the place drew her. Aimlessly strolling
on with time to kill, she thought she would go down
the next parallel street and have a look at Tate’s
Lane from the other end. Perhaps from there she
would see the builder’s yard.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that at just five and twenty
minutes past ten she was slowly sauntering along
Killowen Street.</p>

<p>She had walked a hundred yards or more when
she saw coming towards her a green saloon car
with a figure which looked familiar at the wheel.
No, she was not mistaken; it was indeed Mr. Style!
He was alone, and though he evidently did not see
her, he was stopping, for he was slowing down and
signalling to following drivers. As she stared at
him, he turned the car into an entry almost beside
where she was standing.</p>

<p>Her heart beat fast. Here was news for Mr.
French! Was it possible that where the tremendous
organization of Scotland Yard had failed, she was
going to succeed? Mr. French would revise his
estimate of her. She would prove herself less of a
fool than he had supposed.</p>

<p>At this moment, as he was crossing the footpath,
Style saw her. For the fraction of a second an ugly
gleam shone in his eyes, then he smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Moran,” he called. “This
is an unexpected pleasure. What are you doing in
this part of the world?” His tone was genial and
he looked as if delighted by the meeting.</p>

<p>Molly felt a sudden urge to take to her heels.
Then she saw that she could not do so. Style must
not be allowed to think that she suspected him. She
must satisfy him that the meeting was accidental
and that she did not connect him with the half crown
affair, then pass on and ring up French from the
first shop she came to. If she played her part well
Style would suspect nothing and might stay where
he was until French arrived. She therefore smiled
back at him and walked up to the car.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Style. I didn’t expect to
see you either, though I have often wanted to do
so since our last meeting.”</p>

<p>This piece of mendacity was due to a sudden idea.
If she could engage Style in conversation she would
probably be able to dispel any suspicion he might
have formed. She would tell him that, having come
into some money, she wished to resume betting on
the Monte Carlo tables.</p>

<p>“In that case I’m very pleased that you have
found me. Will you excuse me for one second till
I get the car out of the way of the traffic and then
I shall be at your service.”</p>

<p>He drove the car through the entry, turned it in
the yard, and driving back, stopped inside the entry.
Then he came out to Molly.</p>

<p>“Will you come into the office?” he invited.
“Though I carry on bookmaking as a spare-time job,
I really work in this shop. I think only one clerk
is in at the moment, so that we can talk without
being disturbed.”</p>

<p>In spite of herself Molly hesitated. French’s
warning recurred to her with increased urgency.
Was not this the very thing he had cautioned her
against? Then she told herself she must not be a
coward. She could see through the glass door into
the office. There was nothing terrifying about its
appearance. She could also see the clerk. With
him there and in broad daylight and practically in
a crowded street nothing could possibly happen to
her. Nevertheless it was with some trepidation that
she followed Style in.</p>

<p>He led her through the opening in the counter,
drew a chair forward near the roll-top desk, and
asked her to sit down.</p>

<p>“I’m frightfully sorry,” he declared, “but there
is a bit of business I must attend to before we have
our chat. Do you mind if I leave you for a
moment? The inscription on a football cup which we
are making has been changed and I want to stop
them before they cut the lettering.”</p>

<p>He went out through the door into the entry and
she presently saw him pass the window at the back.
After a short stare the clerk had resumed his
occupation of transcribing entries into a book. His
appearance comforted her strangely. It was impossible,
she felt instinctively, that anyone as stupid
looking as he could be a party to a plot. The sight
through the window of the stream of passers-by and
the sound of their feet on the pavement still further
eased her mind. Reassured, she set herself with a
growing and wholly delicious excitement to await
Style’s return.</p>

<p>She was not impressed by the appearance of the
office. It was positively filthy. The floor looked
as if it hadn’t been swept for weeks and dust lay
thick on the furniture and the calendars and
pictures on the walls. Compared with the spick and
span establishment at the cinema, with its
typewriters, calculating machines, filing cabinets, and
busy air, this place seemed like a reversion to the
conditions of a century earlier. Molly smiled as she
contrasted this uncouth, almost imbecile looking
youth, with his untidy clothes and his inkstained
fingers, with the neatly dressed, efficient staff to
which she was accustomed.</p>

<p>Presently there came the whistle of a speaking
tube. The youth put down his pen and slowly
shuffled across the room to just behind where Molly
was sitting.</p>

<p>“Yeh,” he said. “Yeh. Two bob? Right.”</p>

<p>He plugged the speaking tube, and taking his cap,
lounged slowly out into the street.</p>

<p>Then Style re-entered. He in his turn went to
the speaking tube.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Miss Moran, and I shall be at
your service,” he apologized as he picked it up.
Then he began to speak. “Jenkins . . . Is that
Jenkins? . . . Oh, Jenkins, I want you to get out
that presentation shield that we did last month for
Mr. Hargreaves. I’ve sold it to Otway’s people,
and all we have to do is to change the inscription.
You might——”</p>

<p>The voice suddenly trailed away into silence, as a
sickening blow crashed down on Molly’s head. She
gasped, while momentary stars flashed before her
eyes, then great waves of darkness seemed to rise
up round her and she felt herself sinking down,
down, down, into the blackness of unconsciousness.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Æons of time passed, and then slowly sensation
began to return to Molly Moran. First she realized
only pain, indefinite but terrible pain. Then this
seemed to localize in her head and to pass from
there down through her whole body. Still she was
in darkness, still a roaring sounded in her ears, but
gradually she became conscious of movement. The
place that she was in was shaking. At first she knew
it only as something which added to her misery, but
as she slowly regained her senses she realized where
she was.</p>

<p>The sounds and the movement told her that she
was in a motor car, travelling at a fair rate of speed.
She was lying on the floor of the tonneau, entirely
covered with a rug. This intelligence having sunk
into her brain, experiment told the rest. Attempted
movement showed her that her wrists and ankles
were bound together and at the same time she found
that she was securely gagged. Recollection of the
scene in the silversmith’s office then returned to her
and she knew what had happened. She had been
kidnapped by Style!</p>

<p>Cold terror took possession of her as she
remembered the story French had told her of the
fate of the three girls who had attempted to betray
the gang to the police. Had Thurza Darke, she
wondered, lain bound in the tonneau of this terrible
car as it jolted her on towards her doom? And
what had befallen her at the end of the journey?
Was drowning painful? As Molly pictured what
might have happened a cold sweat of fear broke out
on her. It was too ghastly even to think of. And
yet before many hours, before many minutes
perhaps . . . Almost she swooned away again as she
lay trembling in sick horror, her mind numb and
scarcely functioning.</p>

<p>But she was young and strong. Gradually the
paralyzing sharpness of the first shock passed.
Whatever faults she had, cowardice was not one of
them, and soon she was striving desperately to pull
herself together and to put as brave a face on the
situation as she could. Things in her case were not
quite so hopeless as in that of poor Thurza Darke.
French was looking after her and she would immediately
be missed. He would trace her to the silversmith’s
and so learn what had happened. With the
great organization of the Yard behind him it could
not be long until he found her. In fact he had
evidently foreseen what might occur when he gave her
his warning! Oh, that she had taken that warning!</p>

<p>But suppose he didn’t trace her in time? Resolutely
Molly shut her mind to the suggestion. She
was not dead yet. While there was life there was
hope.</p>

<p>To divert her mind from these harrowing
thoughts she fixed her attention more deliberately
on her surroundings. Could she learn anything as
to her destination from the sounds she heard?</p>

<p>It was immediately clear to her that they were
bowling along at a fair speed on an extremely good
road, asphalted, she thought. But she was conscious
also of a reduction in the sound. She wondered
if this were due to meeting fewer vehicles,
as if so, it would indicate that they were getting
farther from London. As she was considering the
point they slowed down, and turning, she believed
to the right, passed at a slower speed over a road
with a much worse surface. After a few minutes
they stopped altogether and she heard movements
as if her driver were performing some gymnastic
feat in the front seat. Then he got out and walked
round the car and she heard a sort of click behind it.
A moment later he re-entered and again they drove
off.</p>

<p>For what she judged as about ten minutes they
drove slowly along the bad road, then a slack, a
sounding of the horn, another turn and they were
once more on the smooth surface of a main
thoroughfare. A few minutes of this, a few minutes
of another byroad, and after another slack and turn,
the wheels grated on the gravel of a drive. It was
evidently a short one. Then they bumped over some
kind of obstruction and came to rest on a smooth
surface. A rolling sound followed by a clang gave
the necessary hint. They had driven into a yard
and the big entrance gate had been shut behind
them.</p>

<p>Presently she heard muffled voices and the door
of the tonneau was opened. Then she felt herself
being lifted and carried, still rolled in the rug, into
some building and upstairs. One, two, three—six
flights they went up. A few steps more on the level
and she was laid down on something soft.
Immediately the rug and gag were taken off and her
bonds loosed.</p>

<p>She found herself in a dingy, whitewashed attic
with slanting ceilings and a skylight. The lower
walls were stained and dirty and the boarded floor
looked as if it had not been washed for a year. The
furniture consisted of the bed on which she was
lying, a chair, a table, a wash-basin and jug on an
old box, a fireplace with fender and fire irons but no
fire, and in a corner a pile of old, untidy books.
Over her were bending Style and Gwen Lestrange.
They watched her in silence and at the look in their
eyes a paralyzing fear again swept over her.</p>

<p>“So you thought you could get off with it,” Style
said at last, and his voice was like the snarl of some
vicious animal. “You thought you could play the
traitor, speaking us fair and taking our money, and
all the time spying on us and telling that cursed
French what we were doing. You thought you
could, did you?”</p>

<p>Molly was not prepared for this direct attack,
but she countered as well as she could.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? I didn’t tell anyone what
you were doing. Sure how could I when I didn’t
know myself?”</p>

<p>Style shook his clenched fist in her face.</p>

<p>“None of that, you traitor!” he answered
harshly. “You’ve made the mistake of your life!
You thought you had us, but we have you. You’ve
betrayed us to French, but French can’t help you
now. You’re in our power and you’re going to
pay.”</p>

<p>Molly felt his gaze almost as a physical touch.
It sapped her strength, but she clutched her courage
with both hands.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re meaning. Who is
French anyway?”</p>

<p>“Liar!” Style shouted savagely. “Do you think
we’re fools? Do you think we act before we’re
sure? Let me tell you you’ve been watched. When
you were telling French about us on the seat in
Charing Cross Gardens yesterday our agent was
reading the paper within twenty feet of you! He
saw you offering to show French your vanity bag
and French’s quick refusal. And we’ve watched
you with him before. Fool!” he glared at her, “to
think that you could fool us!”</p>

<p>To Molly his abuse seemed to act as a stimulant.
She felt her courage coming back.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she retorted, “you’re a bit off the track,
Mr. Style. That was me uncle you saw me with.
He often meets me and takes me out.”</p>

<p>Gwen Lestrange spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>“Little fool!” she said harshly. “Lies like that
will only finish you up.” But Style held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Just tell us his name,” he demanded with a
suddenly ingratiating manner and a sly look on his
narrow face.</p>

<p>His friendliness terrified Molly even more than
his anger. She realized that she had made a
mistake and tried to recover.</p>

<p>“French,” she admitted. “I see there’s no good
trying to deceive you. And he is an inspector at
Scotland Yard. But he’s me uncle for all that and
he often takes me out and we’ve never discussed
you or your affairs at all.”</p>

<p>Style made a furious gesture.</p>

<p>“You ——!” He used a foul name. “Do you
know what happens to liars and traitors? Did you
ever hear of Smith and the brides of the bath—how
he drowned his wives in a bath? Well, that’s
what’ll happen to you. There’s a bath in the next
room all ready for you. The water rises slowly,
slowly, slowly; up to your mouth, up to your nose,
over your head. French won’t help you then.
Uncle indeed!” He paused and gazed gloatingly
down at the helpless girl.</p>

<p>“He is me uncle,” Molly persisted, but in spite
of herself her voice faltered.</p>

<p>Again Style raved at her.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he shouted. “You’ll get one chance
and one only. Tell us everything that passed
between you and French and we’ll let you go.” He
lowered his voice and spoke almost in persuasive
tones. “Make a clean breast of the whole thing
and we’ll put you in the car and drive you to some
deserted place from which you can make your way
home. You’d like to be back in London, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>He paused expectantly, but Molly did not
answer.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’d like to be free and home again.
Well, tell us everything and you’ll be there in a
couple of hours. Hold back the least fact and
you’ll never see London again. No power in
heaven or earth can save you. Tell me,” he bent
forward again and stared fixedly at her with his
sinister eyes till she felt all the strength draining
out of her, “tell me, did you ever hear of a young
lady named Thurza Darke? Ah, I see you did.
And no one but French could have told you. You
fool, to give that away! Well,” his look became
indescribably evil, “Thurza Darke wouldn’t tell
either, and she went and lay in the bath while the
water slowly rose. . . . We had to stop her screams
lest they should be heard outside the house. Then
after a long time the water rose above her mouth
and she didn’t scream any more. . . . That’s
what’ll happen to you. It’s just next door.” He
motioned with his hand.</p>

<p>Molly couldn’t speak. She felt too sick with
horror. She lay gazing up at that narrow face
with its evil, staring eyes and its expression of
almost maniac hate. Presently Style went on:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t believe me? I tell you there
were more than Thurza Darke. You never heard
of Eileen Tucker, did you? Nor of Agatha
Frinton? You don’t know what happened to them?
Well, you soon will.” He pushed forward his face
till Molly could scarcely refrain from screaming.
“They were drowned in the bath, and afterwards
their bodies were found in rivers and quarryholes.
But yours won’t be found. We’re going to hide it
so that it’ll never be seen again. No one will ever
know what happened to you. Not even your
beloved French will ever know, you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, for heaven’s sake dry up and leave the girl
till we’re ready for her,” burst in Gwen impatiently.
“You’ve something else to do than stand here
spouting like a bum actor in a circus! What about
those machines?”</p>

<p>There was hatred in the look Style turned on
Gwen and something of fear also. But his manner
changed at once.</p>

<p>“You’re right. We must get on,” he said
sullenly, then he turned again to Molly.</p>

<p>“There’s a bell beside the fireplace. If you want
to go back to town ring and we’ll come to hear your
statement. If not—there’s the bath in the next
room!”</p>

<p>He walked to the door, let himself and Gwen
out and locked it. Molly heard their steps
descending the stairs and then all was still.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br/> The Shadows Loom Nearer</h2>

<p>For a few minutes after she had been left alone
Molly lay motionless, too full of horror even to
think. She felt herself near death, and with all the
intensity of her being she longed to live. Never
had life seemed so sweet. She wanted to get out
of this awful room, to see the sun, the fields, the
trees, to feel the fresh air blowing on her cheeks,
to hear the birds and the sounds of life around her.
More than that she wanted to see her friends and
to be once again amid her familiar surroundings in
London. Even to be back in her box office, weary
of it though she often had been, would now be
heaven! But death was before her and at the very
idea she grew once more sick and faint.</p>

<p>However in the course of time her youth and
health once again reasserted themselves. Things
perhaps were not so bad after all. For the time
being at all events, she had a respite. It was
evident that Style and Gwen were profoundly anxious
to find out how much French knew. She believed
they were going to keep her alive in the hope that
they could make her tell. If so, she had only to
refuse to speak and her life would be prolonged.</p>

<p>But this mood of optimism soon passed and terrible
forebodings once more filled her mind. Was
she safe even for the time being? Even if she told
them everything, would she be safe? When they
got all they wanted out of her, would her fate not
still be that of Thurza Darke? For she did not
believe their promise to free her if she did their
bidding. They had not liberated Thurza Darke or
her two unfortunate predecessors. These girls had
almost certainly been forced to reveal what they
knew, but it hadn’t saved them.</p>

<p>The more she thought over her position the lower
sank her heart. There was just one ray of hope.
She would be missed immediately. When she didn’t
turn up at the cinema they would phone to her
boarding house. And her landlady would certainly ring
up the Yard. Mr. French would know within an
hour or at most two. Then he would begin without
delay to trace her. In fact he was probably doing
it at that moment. She had only to hold out so as to
give him time. That was it. To hold out. She
steeled her mind to the idea. No matter what
happened, at no matter what cost to herself, she must
hold out.</p>

<p>But would he trace her in time? She shivered
as the thought forced itself into her mind. Then
resolutely she pulled herself together. She must not
allow herself to dwell on such a possibility.</p>

<p>To occupy her thoughts she got up from the bed
and began to investigate her surroundings. The
room was certainly very dilapidated. From the ceiling
and walls hung festoons of cobweb, and dust and
scraps of old rubbish lay thick on the floor. The
chair and table were of the plainest kind and the
table rocked on three legs. There was no water in
the jug and both it and the basin were thickly
covered with dust. The truckle bed bore blankets but
no sheets, and one of its legs was broken and tied
together with string. In the otherwise empty grate
was an accumulation of dirty rubbish. The skylight
was out of reach, and there being no other
window, she was unable to look out.</p>

<p>The pile of old books in the corner seemed to
offer more promise of distraction and on these she
tried desperately to fix her attention. All were
dusty, but she turned them over in the hope of
finding something which she might force herself to
read. They formed an extraordinary collection, all
very old and all well thumbed. There were two
Bibles, a large one with pictures and a small thin
one on India paper. There were <i>The Lamplighter</i>,
<i>Queechy</i>, <i>The Fairchild Family</i>, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>,
and a number of others of whose names she had
never heard. Most of them were without inscription,
but in one was written in a thin angular hand,
“Christina Wyatt. February 1864.” Molly dully
wondered who Christina could have been and how
her <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> had survived during the sixty
odd years since she had obtained it.</p>

<p>Among the collection was one book which might
throw light on these problems and Molly,
desperately anxious to fill her mind with something
other than her own condition, picked it up and
forced herself to read. It was an old manuscript
book, bearing on the flyleaf the same name and
containing notes in the same thin handwriting as well
as pasted-in cuttings of various kinds. The book
was of fair size, probably nine inches by six and an
inch thick. Only about quarter of it had been filled,
the remaining pages being blank. The notes took
the form of a diary interspersed with moralizings
after the fashion of the period.</p>

<p>But Molly found it utterly impossible to fix her
attention on it. Her own position was too precarious
to allow her to think of anything else. Throwing
the manuscript book back into the corner, she
sat down on the bed, buried her head in her hands
and gave herself up to a detailed consideration of
the situation.</p>

<p>She was trapped. Could she do anything to help
herself? That was the burden of her thoughts. The
problem had been in her mind subconsciously since
her capture, but now she set herself definitely to
think of ways of escape.</p>

<p>But the more she thought, the less hopeful the
idea seemed. There was first of all the door. She
got up and examined it. Opening inwards, it was
strongly made and fitted with a mortise lock whose
heavy bolt she could see passing across the narrow
slit between the edge and the jamb. In no way
could she force the door.</p>

<p>The chimney she could see at a glance was impossible.
Even if she could have climbed it, the opening
above the fireplace was too small to allow her to
pass.</p>

<p>There being no windows, there remained only the
skylight. Could she get out through the skylight?</p>

<p>She lay back on the bed, gazing up at the cobweb
covered square and calculating her chances. If she
moved the bed beneath it, put the old box supplied
as a washstand on the bed and put the chair on the
box, she might be able to reach high enough.
Suddenly eager, she sat up, listening intently. Not a
sound reached her from the house. She decided to
try the experiment at once. Her head still throbbed
from the effects of the blow and she would rather
have lain still. But the faint hope which had been
aroused nerved her to effort.</p>

<p>Moving quietly and making as little noise as
possible, she pulled the bed to the necessary position
and built her tower. A moment later she was
looking through the glass.</p>

<p>But there was not much within view. A vast area
of sky and the tops of a row of distant trees alone
were visible. And when she tried to push up the
skylight a further disappointment awaited her. It
was fastened. Through one of the holes in the
handle a screw had been passed. She tried to move
the screw, but it was too firmly fixed.</p>

<p>For a moment she thought of breaking the glass,
but she saw immediately that the metal bars of the
frame were too close for her to squeeze between
them. Baffled, she got down and stood thinking.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing that she could do.
Slowly she took down the chair and the table and
pushed the bed back to its place. She lay down, her
thoughts approaching more nearly to despair than
at any time since her capture. <em>How</em> she wished
she had minded French’s warning! What a fool
she had been to imagine that she could stand up
against members of a gang of this kind! What
reason had she to imagine she was abler or cleverer
than Thurza Darke? Oh, if when she saw Style
she had just passed on with a bow and smile! If
only she had done that she might now be sitting in
her pay-box at the Panopticon! She had been bored
to tears with that box times without number, but
now how she longed for it! She would have given
all she possessed to be once more within its familiar
walls. But no wishing would get her there.</p>

<p>Slowly the interminable hours dragged away,
while the square of sunshine from the skylight crept
across the wall, narrowed to a line and disappeared.
Presently she realized that she was desperately
hungry. She had had no lunch and now it was
after five o’clock. Surely they couldn’t mean to
starve her?</p>

<p>While she was considering the idea she dropped
into a light sleep. She was roused by the rattling
of the key in the door and sat up blinking as Style
entered with a tray on which was set out a plain
but sufficient supper.</p>

<p>“Asleep?” he said in some surprise. “It’s well
for you that you can take your position so easily!
Or is it that you have not realized its seriousness?”
He paused; then as Molly did not reply, went on:
“Or perhaps you have come to your senses and
decided to tell what you know?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about what you have asked.”</p>

<p>Style shrugged. “Oh, very well,” he answered.
“Have it your own way. I’m sorry. We didn’t
want any more cases like Thurza Darke’s, but it’s
your say.” He put down the tray, then suddenly
spoke with extreme earnestness. “For heaven’s
sake, Molly Moran, don’t be such a fool! Thurza
Darke took the same line as you. She’s dead now.
Don’t think I’m bluffing when I assure you that you’ll
die too if you don’t do what we want. We offer you
the choice of that or of freedom. Don’t be such a
darned fool!”</p>

<p>For a moment Molly was tempted to tell of her
interviews with French. Then something in his
face, a look in his eyes, assured her that she was
being deceived. There was no mercy there. They
would never let her go. Her only chance was to
keep them hoping for information as long as
possible, so as to give French time to trace her. She
rallied her courage.</p>

<p>“It’s your fate that is sealed,” she declared
confidently. “Mr. French knows all about you. You’ve
been warning me, now I’ll warn you. If anything
happens to me, you’ll hang! That’s the way things
are, Mr. Style. Mr. French knows all about Thurza
Darke and he’s taken precautions to prevent you
repeating that. There’s my warning to you.”</p>

<p>Brave words, and yet Molly had scarcely spoken
them before she felt sick with terror. It was a
ghastly mistake to have said that about Thurza
Darke! If they believed it, it would remove her,
Molly’s, chief safeguard. If they thought the
murder of Thurza could be brought home to them it
would not save them to spare Molly. The penalty
was the same for one murder as for two.</p>

<p>But this point of view did not seem to strike
Style. He shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>“Very well, fool,” he snarled. “If you want to
commit suicide, you can,” and turning on his heel,
he strode out, slamming and locking the door.</p>

<p>In spite of her almost frantic state of mind
Molly felt a good deal better when she had finished
the plate of cold roast beef and the bottle of cider
which she found on the tray. If she could but get
the news of her whereabouts through to French she
would be almost happy. Oh, to know that he was
on the way to her help! Was there <em>nothing</em> that
she could do?</p>

<p>Once again she lay down on the bed while she
racked her brains over the problem. Was there
<em>nothing</em> that she could do?</p>

<p>For an hour and more she tossed, then once again
she heard footsteps and the door was unlocked.
This time it was Gwen Lestrange. She carried a
pair of sheets, a can of hot water, soap and other
toilet requisites.</p>

<p>“Here you are, you little fool,” she said
contemptuously as she dumped her burden on the floor.
“You don’t deserve these, but we are not so bad as
you imagine. But I warn you that unless you do
as we want you’ll not need them by tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>She did not wait for a reply, but went out quickly,
locking the door after her.</p>

<p>Though Gwen’s manner was so ungracious, the
articles she had brought made a deal of difference
to Molly. After a wash and brush up she felt so
much happier than when a little later she spread
the sheets on her bed and turned in, she found
herself actually comfortable. Then her anxiety and
fatigues brought their own recompense and she slept
dreamlessly. Indeed, when she woke it was broad
daylight.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock Gwen brought her some
breakfast and then began another weary and
interminable day. She would not have believed had some
one told her previously how slowly time could pass.
Hour after hour she lay on her bed racking her
brains over the problem of escape. Tales she had
read of imprisoned heroines recurred to her, but in
all of them some valiant young man had invariably
appeared in the nick of time and had carried out
the rescue. But in her case there was no such hero.
She had herself to depend on and no one else in
the world.</p>

<p>Except French. Again and again she pictured
French following along that endless road from
London. Momentarily she expected to hear the tumult
of his arrival. But still the interminable silence
remained unbroken.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea flashed into her mind and she
lay still, wondering whether there could be anything
in it. The more she thought, the less sanguine she
grew. However, it was better than nothing. A
forlorn hope, but still a hope.</p>

<p>Again eagerly listening, she once more built her
tower on the bed. Once more she climbed to the
skylight. From her pocket she produced a penny.
Could she turn the screw with it?</p>

<p>Alas, no! The edge was too wide to enter the
slot. One encouraging fact, however, she noticed
which she had missed before. The wood round the
screw was decayed. If only she could get something
to fit the slot she felt sure the screw would not be
hard to turn.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes’ wrestling with the problem
brought her another gleam of hope. Going to the
fireplace, she knelt down and began rubbing the
edge of the penny on the hearthstone. And then
hope changed once more to eagerness. The penny
was deeply scratched. With perseverance she was
sure she could rub its edge thin enough.</p>

<p>But she had not counted on the labour involved.
She rubbed till her whole body ached before she
succeeded. And then it was only to find that owing to
the curve of the penny’s edge it rose out of the slot
when she tried to turn it.</p>

<p>This problem, however, was easier. Another
exhausting period of rubbing on the hearthstone and
she had ground a flat place on the disc, long enough
to meet her purpose.</p>

<p>Few would blame her that she shed a few tears
when, after all her weary work, she found she was
still no nearer her goal. She could not turn the
screw. But once more she pulled herself together.
She had gone so far she <em>would not</em> be beaten. And
very little further thought gave her the solution.</p>

<p>While she was considering some better way of
gripping her penny, her eyes fell on the tongs. They
were old-fashioned with a hinge and flat meeting
faces, not the more modern spring kind with claw
ends. It was the work of a few seconds to grip the
penny in the tongs and try again.</p>

<p>But even yet she was not through. She found she
could not hold the tongs tightly enough to prevent
them opening. But she <em>would not</em> be beaten. Looking
round in desperation her eye fell on the broken
leg of the bedstead. In a moment she was kneeling
on the floor unwinding the cord which held it in
place. Another few seconds and the legs of the
tongs were tied tightly on the penny and she was
again trying the great experiment. Her joy may
be imagined when this time her improvised
screw-driver worked.</p>

<p>The screw removed, she eagerly raised the skylight
and looked out. But at the sight which met
her eyes her tears once again overflowed. All her
work was unavailing. She was no better off.</p>

<p>Away from her the smooth slates of the roof
stretched in every direction, from the ridge above
to the gutter beneath and to the capping of the eaves
to right and left. From where she stood the roof
seemed like a great sloping table-land suspended in
mid-air. It had no visible connection with the earth,
which appeared beyond the gutter, far below and a
long way off. She thought she must be at the back
of the house for there was no road or drive in sight.
She was looking down into fields, behind which was
a wood, forming the horizon. No human being
was in sight nor even a house. So far as she could
see, she might be the only remaining human being
in the world.</p>

<p>No chance of escaping that way. She could not
stand on that slope. With a thrill of horror she
imagined herself climbing out, letting go the
skylight frame, slipping down the smooth slates to the
gutter, gripping it frantically, missing it . . . She
shuddered. No, there was no hope that way. Nor
was there any use in her making signals of distress.
No one was there to see them.</p>

<p>Bitterly disappointed, she stood staring out,
watching lest by chance some wanderer might appear
in the fields whose attention she might be able
to attract. But no one came.</p>

<p>Presently it occurred to her that the time for the
evening meal must be near. Useless as this open
skylight seemed, it would be wiser to keep the
knowledge of it to herself. She therefore closed
the sash, put back the screw loosely, replaced the
furniture, took her screw-driver to pieces, and lay
down on the bed.</p>

<p>Only just in time! She had scarcely settled down
when Gwen appeared with the meal.</p>

<p>Then followed a perfectly interminable night.
This time she had not had the necessary physical
fatigue to make her sleep and she tossed restlessly
during the long, dark hours. But morning came at
last and with it breakfast and the prospects of
another endless day.</p>

<p>She wondered what the plans of the trio could be.
Gwen’s threat as to her end coming before the
previous evening had not been fulfilled. Either their
plans had miscarried or Gwen had been bluffing.
Reassuring, for what it was worth. But they could
not keep her alive and a prisoner indefinitely. They
must, she imagined, be waiting for some development,
though what form it might take she could not
imagine.</p>

<p>Like a century the day dragged out its weary
course. Lunch came, then Gwen with water, then
supper, and still no ray of light or hope appeared
to the girl. Then just as she was preparing for
another long night of wakeful tossing, she got
another idea.</p>

<p>It was far more in the nature of a forlorn hope
than the last, still, she reminded herself, it was a
hope. But if she were to carry out her plan she
must lose no time. It would be dark in less than
an hour.</p>

<p>Now breathlessly excited, she jumped from the
bed, took Christina Wyatt’s old manuscript book,
and cutting the thread which bound it, carefully
withdrew some of the unused sheets. The double
pages were of fair size, some fifteen inches by nine.
Now, could she remember how to fold them? Once
down the middle, the long way; then two corners
back to the middle fold; then . . . For a time she
experimented until at last there lay before her a dart
like those she had made in hundreds in her school-days.
Eagerly she stood up and threw it. It floated
gently across the room.</p>

<p>Mass production was now the order of the day.
There were thirty-seven clean double pages in the
book and in a few minutes thirty-seven darts lay in
a little pile on the bed. As she folded, Molly
thought out the message they would bear, so that by
the time they were ready she had decided on the
wording. Taking her fountain pen, she wrote on
the top of each: “Finder for God’s sake phone
Victoria 7000 that Molly Moran is in this big house.
Her life at stake.”</p>

<p>By this time it was getting dusk. As quickly and
silently as possible Molly rebuilt her tower beneath
the skylight, withdrew the screw and opened the
frame. Then taking up a bunch of darts, she began
to launch them one by one.</p>

<p>There was a gentle wind blowing towards the
left. This picked up the darts and carried them well
away from the house, over towards the fields. They
floated well, and though most of them disappeared
from view below the line of the roof, she saw some
actually strike the ground.</p>

<p>The thirty-seven disposed of, she stood looking
out, hoping against hope that some one would
appear and get her message. But though she waited
till it was quite dark, no one appeared. At last
with a profound sigh she closed the skylight, put the
furniture in its place and lay down once more.</p>

<p>The reaction from her previous excitement had
now set in and her depression became greater than
ever. The darts, she felt, were no good. No one
would find them and if anyone did he would think
the message some child’s prank and take no notice.
Or, and this was a disaster which she had not
thought of before, Gwen or Style might find them.
What would happen to her then? And all the
time in the background was the feeling of sick dread
and horror when she thought of the fate of Thurza
Darke. In the daytime there had been the excitement
of what was happening to keep her up. Now
there was nothing. She learned the awful
loneliness of fear.</p>

<p>Fortunately from sheer exhaustion she fell asleep
quite soon. But it seemed to her that her eyes had
scarcely closed when she was awakened by a
knocking at her door.</p>

<p>“Get up quickly,” came Gwen’s voice. “We’re
moving on. You must be ready in ten minutes.
Here is a lamp.”</p>

<p>The door opened, a small electric lamp was
pushed in and the door was relocked.</p>

<p>Molly looked at her watch. It was still early—only
half past eleven. What was now afoot? Had
her time come?</p>

<p>She had not fully undressed, and almost sick
with terror, she put on the remainder of her things.
But she had not much time to think. Before she
was ready Gwen returned, accompanied by Style. In
silence they seized her and before she realized what
was happening, her wrists and ankles were rebound,
the gag thrust into her mouth and a handkerchief
tied over her eyes. She felt herself being lifted and
carried down the six flights of stairs and along
passages to what was evidently a door, for the night
air blew on her face. Then she was placed on a
seat, she imagined in the same car as before, the
engine was started up and they moved off. After
a few yards they stopped and she heard above the
noise of the running engine the clang of a gate,
some one got in and sat down beside her, and they
moved off.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch18">

<h2>Chapter XVIII. <br/> When Greek Meets Greek</h2>

<p>It was shortly after eleven o’clock on that same
night that news came to Inspector French. Fed
up with the whole business and tired out, he was
actually on his way upstairs when his telephone rang.</p>

<p>“News of Miss Moran, sir,” came the voice of
the sergeant on duty at the Yard. “Hold the line
and I’ll put you through.” There was a pause and
then another voice sounded.</p>

<p>“Is that Victoria 7000? If so, I have a message
for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Repeat your message, please.”</p>

<p>“I’m speaking from near Guildford. Between
eight and nine my little nipper was coming home
through a field and he found some paper darts with
this message written on each: ‘Finder for God’s
sake phone Victoria 7000 that Molly Moran is in
this big house. Her life at stake.’ We took it for
a joke, but I am ringing up on chance.”</p>

<p>French wiped a film of sweat off his forehead.</p>

<p>“It’s no joke I can assure you. This is Scotland
Yard and we know something of the affair. Tell
me, please, who you are and where you’re speaking
from.”</p>

<p>An expression of amazed concern came through,
then the voice went on: “I am Mr. Edward Boland,
speaking from my house, Dehra Dun, Elmford.
I—I hope it’s all right?”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” French returned grimly. “Tell me,
where is the big house mentioned?”</p>

<p>“It’s at the other end of the village; Mr.
Trevellian’s, the novelist’s.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Boland, could you lend me a hand
at your end? It may save the girl’s life. How far
are you from the police station?”</p>

<p>“It’s in the village, five minutes’ walk from here.”</p>

<p>“Good. Will you take the darts there and hand
them to whoever is on duty and tell him your story.
Tell him that you have rung me up, Inspector
French, C.I.D., and say that I shall be going down
immediately. Can you manage that?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Inspector. I’ll do it now.”</p>

<p>Ten seconds after Boland had rung off French
was talking to the Yard.</p>

<p>“Get six men together at once, Deane, and two
cars with petrol for a long run. I want to go to
near Guildford. I’ll be with you by the time you’re
ready. And look sharp, for goodness’ sake! It’s
more than urgent.”</p>

<p>By a lucky chance French picked up a taxi almost
at his own door, and soon he was giving his
instructions to Deane in person.</p>

<p>“Got those cars? Right. I want you to ring up
the police station at Elmford, near Guildford. Tell
them to take the message seriously that Mr. Boland
is bringing them: they’ll understand. Tell them that
I’ll be with them in an hour and that in the
meantime they are to surround Mr. Trevellian’s house
and allow no one to leave; let them detain on
suspicion anyone who tries to. Explain that we think
these people have a girl in their power and say that
if the sergeant has any reason to suspect foul play
he’s not to wait for authority, but to break in. I’ll
stand the racket.”</p>

<p>A minute later two fast cars left the Yard. In
the first were French, Carter, and two other men.
The second contained Sergeant Harvey and another
two assistants. Contrary to custom all were armed.
French had with him the warrants he had previously
obtained for the arrest of the members of the gang
and he was determined if necessary to strain a point
and use these to cover the search of the house.</p>

<p>“Don’t kill anybody,” he told the driver, “but
don’t be longer in one place than you need,” and
they roared on, their speed increasing continually as
they left London farther behind.</p>

<p>The night was calm but dark. The light which
should have come from the quarter moon was
obscured by clouds. It was now fine, but there had
been a shower earlier and the roads were heavy.
Five and twenty minutes after leaving the Yard
they ran through Kingston and in another twenty
Ripley was left behind. From Ripley to Guildford
they had a clear road and they fairly hummed along,
but they had an exasperating slack through the town.
Then for the remaining three miles they were able
to put on another spurt, reaching the police station
at Elmford just an hour and three minutes after
starting. A constable hurried out and saluted.</p>

<p>“Inspector French, sir?” he said. “The sergeant’s
at Mr. Trevellian’s. First turn to the left
and first house on the left-hand side.” He pointed
down the street.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes brought them to the place.
As they drew up at the entrance to the drive two
shadows moved forward.</p>

<p>“Inspector French, sir?” said the larger of the
two. “I’m Sergeant Biggle and this is Mr. Boland.
No one has entered or left the house since we got
your phone, but one of our men saw a car leave as
he was on his rounds.”</p>

<p>“At what hour was that?”</p>

<p>“Eleven-forty, sir. It was too dark to see details,
but he believed it was Mr. Trevellian’s green
Armstrong Siddeley. They turned in the direction
of Farnham.”</p>

<p>“Could he say how many people were in it?”</p>

<p>“No, it is a saloon and it was too dark to see more
than the outline.”</p>

<p>French nodded. “Now as to Mr. Trevellian.
Describe him, please.”</p>

<p>“A rather stout, undersized man with bright red
hair, a pale complexion, and blue eyes.”</p>

<p>French felt a sudden thrill. This could surely
be none other than that Jim Sibley of whom
Cullimore and Dove had spoken, the engineer who had
been dismissed from the Mint for theft.</p>

<p>“Anyone else live here?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Trevellian. She’s a tall, well-built woman
with fair hair and complexion, blue eyes, and a
strong chin.”</p>

<p>Better and better! Gwen Lestrange, for a
certainty!</p>

<p>“Right. They’re the people we want. Anyone
else?”</p>

<p>“There’s Mr. Marwood, Mr. Elmer Marwood.
He’s brother to Mrs. Trevellian and lives with
them. He goes into town every day, mostly in Mr.
Trevellian’s car. A thinnish, pale-complexioned
man with a small straw-coloured moustache and
glasses. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Style! That made four, including Welland.
French would have betted long odds it was the lot.
He turned to Carter.</p>

<p>“Take charge, Carter,” he directed. “Surround
the house and go in and search it. If they don’t
open immediately, break in. You needn’t mind
making a noise. Only look sharp. Now, Mr. Boland,
you told me your son found these darts between
eight and nine, but you didn’t ring up till
after eleven. I’m not finding fault, sir, but could
you not have done better than that?”</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry, Inspector, but you see I didn’t
know about it. My wife and I were dining out and
the servant was on leave. The boy was alone in
the house. He’s only eight. Against orders he
waited up for me, and though I thought it was a
hoax, I rang you up at once.”</p>

<p>“I understand, sir. It was not your fault, but it
was a pity all the same. Now, sergeant,” he went
on to Biggle, “I want you to go back to your office
and put through a general call to all surrounding
stations. Describe the car and the party and give their
direction as far as we know it. Where would you
get to if you went through Farnham?”</p>

<p>“Southampton or Salisbury, I should think, sir.”</p>

<p>“Southampton it’ll be,” said French. “They’re
making for the ships. Well, ring up, will you,
especially to Southampton and places on the way there.
Tell them all to report to you if there is news, and
do you stand by to repeat it to me when I ring up.
That all clear?”</p>

<p>The sergeant repeated his instructions, and
French hurried after Carter. In some way the
latter had obtained entrance, for a constable stood
guarding the open hall door. Within a rapid search
was in progress.</p>

<p>“Got in through the pantry window, sir,” said
Carter, appearing suddenly in the hall. “The house
is deserted, but they’ve been coining in the cellar,
though the machines are gone. Down there, if you’d
like to have a look.”</p>

<p>“I’ll run down for a moment. Make sure that
girl’s not in the house and meet me in the hall.”</p>

<p>French’s “look,” brief though it was, left him still
more impressed with the amount of thought and
labour that had been put into the coining scheme.
The cellar, a large, whitewashed room, had been
fitted up elaborately. The windows had been built
up, but a system of Tobin’s tubes had been installed
for ventilation, and the place was brilliantly lit with
electric light. On the benches lay hundreds of
partially finished coins, tools and other debris. The
places where presses had stood were clearly marked,
but all the machines had been removed. There had
been several of these, some, the foundations
suggested, of a considerable size.</p>

<p>The sight cleared up a point which had been
bothering French, why the gang had not made off more
quickly after becoming suspicious that the police
were on their track. The removal of these machines
supplied the reason. These people were not going
to give up coining because that particular pitch had
grown too hot for them. Clearly they were going
to break fresh ground and start again. In some
other great city the mortality among box office girls
would soon be on the up-grade—unless he, French,
stopped it.</p>

<p>When he reached the hall Carter was descending
the stairs. No, there was no trace of anyone in
the house, but there was a partially furnished attic,
the only room above the ground floor which showed
signs of recent occupation, in which the young lady
might have been imprisoned.</p>

<p>“And that,” went on Carter, “is next the field
where Mr. Boland said the darts were found. I
expect she was there all right.”</p>

<p>“Very well; let’s get on.”</p>

<p>As none of French’s party knew the roads, they
took a local constable as guide. Warned of the
urgency of the case, the driver put on every ounce
of power and they snorted on at a breakneck pace
through the night. Fortunately the road was good
and other traffic practically non-existent, or disaster
might have overtaken them. French sat in front,
tense and watchful, though with his mind full of the
problems which still remained. He believed that
this was the last lap and that the party in front
represented the entire gang. He could now see the
function of each. Trevellian, or Sibley, to make
the stuff; Style to take it to town and to obtain and
bring down the raw materials; Welland to see to its
distribution; Gwen to trap the necessary girls and
doubtless do other odds and ends as might be
required. And Sibley’s guise of an author was just
what might have been expected. It would account
for his living in the country as well as for his long
absences during the day. French could imagine the
casual caller. “Where is Mr. Trevellian? I should
like to ask him so and so.” “Oh, he’s writing. He
doesn’t like to be disturbed when he’s at work.”
It was a good, well-thought-out scheme. These
people had deserved to succeed.</p>

<p>Presently there came houses—Farnham.</p>

<p>A hurried call to Elmford told them that there
was no news and the chase was resumed. French
was now much more anxious. He was running on
towards Southampton on the mere strength of his
summing of the probabilities. But he might be
wrong. That start towards Farnham might have
been a blind, and every mile might easily be
increasing his distance from the quarry. If so, Molly
Moran’s chances would be pretty thin—assuming,
indeed, that she were still alive.</p>

<p>But there was nothing else for it, and they hurried
on. French glanced at his watch; it was just
past two o’clock. If the gang had gone this way
they must have passed nearly two hours earlier and
nearly an hour before he telephoned. If they had
been seen it would only have been by the merest
chance.</p>

<p>At five minutes past two they ran into Alton and
stopped at the police station. Again no luck! The
Elmford sergeant telephoned that he had heard
nothing.</p>

<p>The difficulty of French’s problem was now
increased tenfold. Should he go on? If the others
were not making for Southampton, to do so would
probably mean losing them altogether. But there
was no time for hesitation. Rightly or wrongly, he
would back his judgment.</p>

<p>“On towards Southampton,” he ordered, and once
again they began their mad rush through the endless
night.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes to three they reached the
suburbs of Winchester and a couple of minutes later
French was again ringing up Elmford. Then his
weight of fear and doubt was suddenly eased and
he felt a thrill of the keenest satisfaction. There
was news!</p>

<p>On receiving Sergeant Biggle’s call the officer in
charge at Southampton had instantly sent men round
the roads in the vicinity to warn the patrols who
were already out on their beats. Just five minutes
earlier one of these men had returned to say that a
car answering the description in question had passed
through the village of Old Netley at about two a.m.
It had come from the direction of Hedge End and
gone on towards the sea. Hedge End was in a
direct line from Winchester to Netley.</p>

<p>“Netley! Hard as you like!” French cried as he
swung himself back into the car.</p>

<p>Luckily their guide had once been stationed at
Southampton and knew the district. They ran on
at full speed to Botley, then turning back west, went
south through Hedge End. There they left the
main road and at a necessarily reduced speed ran
through Old Netley and down to the shore of
Southampton Water at the end of the little town of
Netley.</p>

<p>Here was another problem for French. The
road down which they had come debouched at right
angles into a road running parallel to the shore.
Should they turn up or down channel?</p>

<p>“Where does that road go to?” he asked the
guide, pointing down towards the sea.</p>

<p>“Just to Netley town and the hospital, sir, though
you can get on to Hamble. But they wouldn’t have
gone that way because there’s a direct road from
Winchester to Hamble through Hound.”</p>

<p>“Very well; turn to the right.”</p>

<p>This, the guide explained, would bring them in a
couple of miles to Southampton, through the suburb
of Woolston. French, deciding that he would make
for the police station, nodded.</p>

<p>After passing a grove of trees at Hilton the road
ran down along the sea, being separated from the
actual beach by a strip of unfenced grass some thirty
yards wide. To be so near a great port, the place
was extraordinarily secluded. The clouds had now
uncovered the quarter moon and so far as French
could see in the dim light, there was not a house in
sight. Away in front were the lights of Southampton
and out on the water were the riding lights of
steamers, with an occasional twinkle from the Hythe
shore opposite. But the nearer shore was dark and
deserted. Anything, thought French, might go on
there and no one would be a bit the wiser.</p>

<p>As he looked out over the black water his face
suddenly grew grim. He thought he could now
account for the route the others had taken. They
were going to Southampton all right, but they had
something to do first. There was dangerous
evidence—to be destroyed. There in the water,
somewhere out in the darkness towards Hythe he dared
swear was now floating the body of the poor little
Irish girl. He sighed as he thought of the narrow
chance on which the thing had turned. If only that
man Boland had not been out when his son found
the darts! Ah, well, it couldn’t be mended now.
But there was still one thing to be seen to and
French set his teeth as he thought of it. They
should pay, these ruffians, pay in full measure,
pressed down and running over. Until all four
were either in jail or dead, he would not rest. Poor
little Molly!</p>

<p>And then something happened which completely
altered his outlook and set him thinking furiously.
The road turned sharply inland and as they swung
round the bend they passed a man.</p>

<p>He was walking to meet them and owing to the
curve he momentarily got the full benefit of their
headlights. But that moment was enough. In spite
of the fact that his hat was pulled down over his
eyes and his collar turned up about his cheeks,
French recognized him. It was Style!</p>

<p>French had never seen Style, but he had had so
many descriptions of him that no doubt was possible.
The man was walking quickly as if late for an
appointment.</p>

<p>For five seconds French thought hard. Then as
they passed round the curve out of Style’s view he
stopped the cars and hurriedly assembled his men.</p>

<p>“Style!” he explained rapidly. “After him, but
on your lives not a sound!”</p>

<p>For big men, as most of the officers were, their
movements were surprisingly silent as they followed
French at the double. When they regained the
shore the grass muffled their footsteps and such
slight sounds as they made were lost in the dreary
moaning of the wind and the plash of the waves
on the beach. Presently they caught sight of Style.
He had left the road and was picking his way down
to the water’s edge. French and his followers
dropped on their hands and knees and crawled on
till they were directly behind him.</p>

<p>Style, having reached the edge, stopped and stood
looking out over the water. He seemed to be doing
something with his hands, but French could not
imagine what.</p>

<p>Then he knew. From the sea came three flashes
as from an electric torch, and with these as a guide
French found he could detect a blacker smudge
against the dark water. A vessel of some kind,
close inshore and showing no lights.</p>

<p>As they watched, a second smaller smudge detached
itself from the other. Some one was coming
ashore.</p>

<p>Almost instinctively a plan flashed into French’s
mind. After a whispered word to his men he began
slowly to creep up behind Style. Style seemed uneasy,
but it was not till French was beside him that
he turned. At the same instant French sprang and
with a muffled cry the man came down.</p>

<p>He fought like a maniac, but Carter and Harvey
had come up and he had no chance. In a few
seconds he was helpless, bound and gagged.</p>

<p>“Once again,” whispered French.</p>

<p>He had snatched off Style’s hat and putting this
on and turning up his collar, he stood waiting as
the other had done. The boat was now close inshore
and revealed itself as a collapsible punt with a
capacity for two. A short, stout man was rowing.</p>

<p>“Thought you’d never be back,” the stout man
grumbled as the punt touched the ground. “For
heaven’s sake look alive now. We don’t want to be
here all night.”</p>

<p>Further remark died off into a kind of gurgle.
French had seized him by the throat. This man
also after the first moment of surprise fought like a
tiger, but once again the odds were too heavy. In a
few seconds he lay bound beside his accomplice.</p>

<p>“Now, Carter, it’s you and me for it,” French
panted. “However many there may be they’re two
fewer for this. You, Harvey, get the others and
have those two men into one of the cars. Then come
down and be prepared to lend a hand.”</p>

<p>Rapidly they righted and emptied the boat, which
had been upset in the struggle, and French and
Carter got in.</p>

<p>“I’ll row,” French decided. “I’m more the size
of that second fellow. You take Style’s hat and turn
up your collar. And have your gun ready.”</p>

<p>Old hand as he was, French’s heart was beating
more rapidly than could be accounted for by his
scrap as he pulled out towards the launch. These
were desperate men, their escape almost consummated.
They would not lose their freedom for the sake of
the lives of a couple of policemen. French had no
delusions as to the possibility that neither he nor
Carter might ever see another sunrise.</p>

<p>“We want to take them alive,” he said in low
tones, “but if you see them going to shoot get in
first.”</p>

<p>The boat was closer inshore than French had
supposed. As they came close they saw that she was
a motor launch of some forty-five feet long. She
seemed a sea boat, well decked over forward. On
her deck astern stood a man and woman.</p>

<p>“It’s about time you thought of coming,” called
out the man when they were within earshot. “What
the —— hell were you monkeying about ashore?
We’ll not be clear of the Island by daylight at this
rate.”</p>

<p>Welland! And the woman was certainly Gwen
Lestrange! French murmured a husky reply in a
tone as like that of the former oarsman as he could.
But his effort was not good enough. The two
started and called out simultaneously in tones of
urgent anxiety.</p>

<p>“Sibley!” cried Welland. “Speak clearly, can’t
you!” While Gwen shouted: “Jim! Is that you?
Answer!”</p>

<p>French put down his head and pulled with all
his might. The boat bounded forward. There
was a sudden scuffle on deck. “Look out, it’s
French!” came in a shrill scream from Gwen, while
with a savage oath Welland roared: “Start the —— engine!
For your life, Gwen! I’ll pot them if they
try to come aboard!” The voices of both had an
edge of desperate urgency.</p>

<p>Like a flash the girl leaped to the cabin door, and
after fumbling at its lock, disappeared within.
Welland at the same time dashed across the deck, seized
what appeared to be a top coat and began hurriedly
searching its pockets. At that moment the boat
came alongside and both French and Carter sprang
at the rail and began to climb aboard. But they
were too late. Before French reached the deck
Welland found what he wanted. His hand flew up and
in it was something shining. And then, just as he
was about to fire, a flying figure appeared from the
cabin—the figure of a girl. She dashed to Welland
and as the jet of flame spurted from the pistol,
struck desperately at his arm. French felt a searing
pain in his head, but he was not disabled and he
sprang across the deck to Welland. He had a vision
of the girl reeling wildly back, and with her scream
ringing in his ears, he closed. For a moment it
seemed as if things would go badly with him. Welland
was the bigger man and he was evidently in
excellent training. He got in a lefthander over
French’s heart which left the latter sick and
quivering. But French concentrated his whole will power
on holding his grip of the other’s wrist and
preventing him turning the pistol inwards. Then Carter
joined in and the thing was a matter of time. In
three minutes Welland was bound like his confrères
ashore.</p>

<p>“Look out for Gwen,” gasped French, as he
dragged himself over to where Molly Moran lay
in a motionless heap against the deckhouse wall.</p>

<p>Carter locked the cabin door, then turned to help
French with the unconscious girl. They stretched
her out on the deck and bathed her face and hands.</p>

<p>“Only stunned, I think,” French went on hoarsely.
“I suppose you realize, Carter, that if she hadn’t
been such a plucky one you and I would be down in
Davy Jones’s locker now. You owe your life to her,
man, and so do I.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see just what happened. It was all
over and we were scrapping round before I knew
where I was.”</p>

<p>“It’s clear enough what happened. They had
locked her in the cabin and when Gwen went to start
the engine she didn’t wait to close the door. Molly
dashed out and knocked up this beauty’s hand as he
was firing. It was a close thing, Carter. I felt a
bullet pass my head. Ah, there. Thank God for
that!”</p>

<p>Molly had opened her eyes and was making a pathetic
attempt to smile. At sight of it French forgot
himself in the most lamentable manner. Fortunately
no one who mattered was there to see his
lapse. French—alas that it must be recorded!—caught
the girl up in his arms and implanted not one
but two hearty kisses on her mouth.</p>

<p>“My word, Molly, but you’re the goods!” he declared
in rather shaky tones. “If I was about a hundred
years younger and there was no Mrs. French
you’d be listening to a proposal of matrimony.
You’re really nothing the worse, child?”</p>

<p>And the abandoned creature, instead of indignantly
protesting against his conduct and demanding
a commission of inquiry into the whole circumstances,
smiled up into his face and agreed that, everything
considered, she was really very well indeed.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX. <br/> Conclusion</h2>

<p>Little more remains to be told.</p>

<p>When Gwen Lestrange, to give her the name by
which she had been known to French—she was
really Mrs. James Sibley—saw from the cabin the
turn affairs had taken, she surrendered at discretion.
It appeared that there were no other members of the
gang, and before morning all four prisoners were
safely lodged in the cells.</p>

<p>With the additional knowledge he now possessed,
French immediately began a more detailed inquiry
into their misdeeds and before long the entire
details of the coining scheme were revealed.</p>

<p>It seemed that Jim Sibley had long been convinced
as to the possibility of profitably counterfeiting
silver coins. Even with these composed of nearly
pure silver he believed the thing could be done, but
the passing of the Act of 1920 reducing the proportion
of pure silver to fifty per cent and the subsequent
fall in the price of silver left no doubt in his
mind. When therefore he found himself dismissed
from the Mint it had occurred to him that an auspicious
time had arrived to test the truth of his
convictions.</p>

<p>He was up, however, against one overwhelming
difficulty. He had no capital and the inception of
his scheme required what was to him a big sum. For
a time his plans hung fire and then he saw his way.</p>

<p>From some of his dubious acquaintances he had
heard from time to time of a Mr. Curtice Welland,
or, as he then called himself, Hervey Westinghouse.
Welland, to give him the name he afterwards
took, was looked upon by the fraternity of
the underworld as an example of a strikingly
successful career. He was reported to live by
blackmail and it was hinted that on different occasions
he had paid large sums for “jobs,” mostly the
burglary of some well-known persons’ houses for
letters of a profitable type. Sibley came to the
conclusion that if Welland could be interested in his
scheme, the necessary capital would materialize.
He introduced himself, sounded the other, and to
make a long story short, the firm of Sibley, Sibley &amp;
Welland came into being.</p>

<p>When they came to work out the details they
found that a fourth member would be required. Here
again Welland filled the breach. In his toils was
a man called Webster, afterwards “Style.” Owing
to an irregularity in connection with the signature
of a cheque, Style had handed over his freedom to
Welland and he was now told what he must do.
Unwillingly Style came in and the quartet started
work.</p>

<p>The necessary machines were ordered to be sent
to certain ports in the names of various foreign
medal making firms, to be kept till called for. There
Style, in the guise of an emissary from the foreign
firms, obtained them, ostensibly to arrange for their
shipment. In reality he ran them in his car to the
house near Guildford, which in the meantime had
been rented by the Sibleys.</p>

<p>Some means of buying silver without arousing
suspicion in the trade being an essential, the
silversmiths’ works was purchased, Style becoming the
“manager.” All the members of the staff who
showed any intelligence were dispensed with, enough
being retained merely to keep the place open. Style
bought the silver in the name of Theobald &amp; Grudgin
and secretly transferred what Sibley required to his
garage, bringing it home to Guildford in the car.</p>

<p>The guise of an author enabled Sibley to withdraw
himself during long periods on each day, and
his wife helped him with the manufacture of the
coins. It was considered unsafe for either of these
two or Style to take part in their distribution, so
this was undertaken by Welland in the way French
had already discovered.</p>

<p>Every morning and night, while passing along a
quiet stretch of byroad, Style changed the number
of his car and slightly altered his appearance by
putting in a different set of false teeth, brushing his
hair and moustache differently, and putting on
glasses and a differently shaped hat. Because of this
and also of the fact that in his earlier circulars
French had described the grey car used by Welland
instead of Style’s green vehicle, he succeeded in
avoiding recognition.</p>

<p>It was part of Style’s duty to spend a good part
of his time in shadowing the four box office girls
whom they had made their dupes. French’s
inquiries were thus early known to the gang. Welland
instantly saw through the trick of the broken
window and this convinced the gang that they were
in dangerous waters. The manufacture of coins was
suspended while Sibley and his wife, both disguised,
shadowed the girls. French’s interview with Molly
in the Charing Cross Gardens thus became known
to them and they saw that they were on the eve of
discovery. At once a message was got through to
Style to supply Welland with “good” coins for the
girls. Style kept a supply in his safe for this
purpose, and he passed good bundles to Welland,
replacing them with the four faked lots he had brought
to town. It was in this way that the coins obtained
by French from Molly proved to be good, while
those which he found in Style’s safe were faked.</p>

<p>The eventuality which the quartet found themselves
up against they had long foreseen and provided
against. Their idea was that if England
should get too hot to hold them, they would transfer
their activities to France. Welland had therefore
bought the launch, storing it at Ryde. They were
determined, however, not to go without their plant,
and preparations for the removal of this were in
hand when the whole situation was altered by
Molly’s recognition of Style at the silversmiths’.</p>

<p>Style instantly saw that if Molly were allowed
to see French again they were done for. French
would get on his trail and would find the house at
Guildford before the plant had been got away. He
therefore decided to kidnap her, so as to gain the
necessary time for this operation.</p>

<p>The question of whether she should not be murdered
like those of her predecessors who had shown
a desire to communicate with Scotland Yard was
carefully considered and her life was spared as a
sort of forlorn hope. If by some unlikely chance
French should discover their flight before they got
clear away, Molly was to be exhibited and French
was to be told that if he attempted to prevent their
escape she should be shot then and there in cold
blood. They thought this might make him hesitate
sufficiently to enable them to effect their purpose.</p>

<p>By the evening of the day on which Molly was
kidnapped all the preparations for the flight were
complete and if the gang had then bolted in all
probability they would have got clear away. But
an unexpected hitch at the last minute delayed them
for two days and led to their undoing. Welland
found that he could not start the engine of the
launch, and he lost two vital days at Ryde in getting
the defect put right.</p>

<p>The working out of a method of trans-shipping
their plant from car to launch proved one of their
most difficult problems. The need for secrecy
forbade the use of a wharf and crane and they knew
of no natural harbour or rock from which the
machines could be embarked. They therefore chose
the position on Southampton Water, one of the rare
“hards” on a shore of soft and sedgy flats. At low
water they ran the car down on the beach, unloaded
and buoyed the machines, and when the tide rose
floated the launch to the place and hoisted the
machines on board. Two journeys of the car had
been necessary to transport all the plant, the second
being that by which Molly had been taken. On
reaching the shore for the second time the
balance of the machines had been unloaded and the
whole of the party except Style had gone on board.
Style utilized the time until the tide rose high enough
to lift the machines in attempting a further
safeguard. With the object of confusing the chase,
should one materialize, he had run the car into
Southampton, and it was when walking back after
abandoning it there that French and his party met
him.</p>

<p>Though French found out all these details without
much difficulty, he was at more of a loss to prove
the responsibility of the gang for Thurza Darke’s
murder. But eventually he managed this also. The
attendant at the Milan identified Gwen Lestrange
as the young woman who had called for Thurza on
the night of her disappearance, and Dr. Lappin, of
Lee-on-the-Solent, swore that Style exactly met the
description of the man who was attending to the
engine of the grey car on the road near Hill Head.
This evidence, added to the rest that French had
collected, secured a verdict of guilty, and eventually
all four paid for their crimes, Welland and Sibley
on the scaffold and the other two with life sentences.</p>

<p>Before his death Welland made a full confession.
In it he admitted that he and Sibley had murdered
all three girls in the horrible and revolting way with
which Style had threatened Molly. Following the
example of Smith, the “brides in the bath”
murderer, they had drowned their unfortunate victims
in the bath in the house at Guildford before disposing
of their bodies in the quarry hole, the river,
and the sea respectively.</p>

<p>Of all the parties to the transaction, Molly came
off the best. Not only was she not prosecuted, but
on the grounds that the amount was unknown, the
question of her ill-gotten gains was not raised.
Most immorally, therefore, she found herself in
possession of the nice little sum of nearly four
hundred pounds as her share of the affair.</p>

<p>As for French, the consciousness of work well
(if slowly) done was his reward. The case had
been an unusually troublesome and disappointing
one, but he had at least the satisfaction of knowing
that he had not only in all probability saved Molly
Moran’s life and the lives of other girls who might
have fallen into the hands of the gang, but had
cleared out a nest of evildoers whose removal was
essential to the welfare of the entire country.</p>
